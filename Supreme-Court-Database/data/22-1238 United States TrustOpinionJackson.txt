															OFFICE OF THE UNITED STATES TRUSTEE,
PETITIONER v. JOHN Q. HAMMONS FALL 2006, LLC, et al.

															on writ of certiorari to the united states
court of appeals for the tenth circuit

															[June 14, 2024]

															

															Justice Jackson delivered the opinion of the
Court.

															Two Terms ago, in Siegel v.
Fitzgerald, 596 U.S. 464 (2022), we held that a statute
violated the Bankruptcy Clause’s uniformity requirement because it
permitted different fees for Chapter 11 debtors depending on the
district where their case was filed. See id., at 479–480,
and n. 2. Today, we are asked to determine the remedy for that
constitutional violation. We agree with the Government that the
appropriate remedy is prospective parity. Requiring equal fees for
otherwise identical Chapter 11 debtors going forward comports with
congressional intent, corrects the constitutional wrong, and
complies with due process.

															Resisting this conclusion, respondents, a group
of Chapter 11 debtors, argue that they are entitled to a refund.
But, as respondents forthrightly concede, adopting their preferred
remedy would require us to undercut congressional intent and
transform, by judicial fiat, a program that Congress designed to be
self-funding into an estimated $326 million bill for taxpayers.
Neither remedial principles nor due process requires that
incongruous result. We reverse.

															I

															A

															The federal bankruptcy system is administered
by two programs. See id., at 468–470. The U. S. Trustee
Program, housed within the Department of Justice, administers 88 of
the 94 bankruptcy districts. The six remaining districts, all in
Alabama and North Carolina, are administered by the Bankruptcy
Administrator Program, which the Administrative Office of the
U. S. Courts runs under the supervision of the Judicial
Conference.

															For our purposes, the most salient difference
between these two programs is their funding. Congress designed the
U. S. Trustee Program to be entirely self-funded by user fees
paid by debtors. See 28 U. S. C. §589a(b). By contrast,
Congress supports the Bankruptcy Administrator Program through its
general appropriation for the Judiciary, with fees used only to
offset that funding. See §1930(a)(7).

															Despite these different funding schemes, the
fees charged to debtors in U. S. Trustee and Bankruptcy
Administrator districts were identical between 2001 and 2018. See
Siegel, 596 U. S., at 470. During that almost
two-decade period, Congress would set the filing and quarterly fees
for U. S. Trustee districts, and then the Judicial Conference,
pursuant to a standing order, would require Bankruptcy
Administrator districts to match them. See ibid. (citing
Report of the Proceedings of the Judicial Conference of the United
States 46 (Sept./Oct. 2001) (Report Proceedings)).

															In 2017, facing a funding shortfall for the
U. S. Trustee Program, Congress amended the fee statute to
raise fees in U. S. Trustee districts. See 596 U. S., at
470–471. Specifically, Congress increased quarterly fees for new
and pending Chapter 11 cases in which debtors disbursed $1 million
or more in that quarter. See Div. B, 131Stat. 1232 (2017 Act).
Consistent with its goal of maintaining a self-funding U. S.
Trustee Program, Congress made the fee increase for large debtors
conditional on the operating fund for the program falling below
$200 million in the prior fiscal year. See Siegel, 596
U. S., at 470–471. That threshold was met in 2017, so,
starting in January 2018, fees increased for large Chapter 11
debtors in U. S. Trustee districts. See ibid.

															Despite the Judicial Conference’s standing
order, though, fees did not immediately increase in Bankruptcy
Administrator districts. See ibid. For reasons that remain
obscure, it was not until October 2018 that the Judicial Conference
increased fees for newly filed cases in Bankruptcy Administrator
districts. See Report Proceedings 11–12 (Sept. 13, 2018). And fees
for already pending large Chapter 11 cases in Bankruptcy
Administrator districts remained at their 2017 level until Congress
mandated equal fees in 2021. See Pub. L. 116–325, §3(d)(2),
134Stat. 5088 (2021 Act). In the interim, a disparity emerged
between the fees paid by large Chapter 11 debtors in U. S.
Trustee districts and those paid by large Chapter 11 debtors in
Bankruptcy Administrator districts. See Siegel, 596
U. S., at 478–479.

															B

															In Siegel, we traced the origin of that
disparity to a single statutory word. See id., at 479–480.
The fee statute passed by Congress, and in effect at the time of
the 2017 increase, read: “[T]he Judicial Conference of the United
States may require the debtor in a case under chapter 11 of
title 11” in a Bankruptcy Administrator district “to pay fees equal
to those imposed” on otherwise identical debtors in U. S.
Trustee districts. 28 U. S. C. §1930(a)(7) (emphasis
added). That permissive language, we explained, violated the
Constitution’s Bankruptcy Clause. Siegel, 596 U. S., at
480, n. 2.

															The Bankruptcy Clause empowers Congress “[t]o
establish . . . Laws on the subject of Bankruptcies
throughout the United States,” but it requires that such laws be
“uniform.” Art. I, §8, cl. 4. Though the Clause “confers broad
authority on Congress,” including the flexibility to “enact
geographically limited bankruptcy laws . . . if it is
responding to a geographically limited problem,” we concluded that
the Clause’s grant of power did not extend to the disparate fees
facilitated by the permissive language in the fee statute.
Siegel, 596 U. S., at 476–477. As we explained,
Congress could not constitutionally “treat identical debtors
differently based on an artificial funding distinction that
Congress itself created.” Id., at 479–480.

															Having found a constitutional wrong, we then
faced the question of how to remedy it. We acknowledged three
options: (1) refund fees for those charged more in U. S.
Trustee districts, (2) retroactively extract higher fees from those
charged less in Bankruptcy Administrator districts, or (3) require
only prospective parity. See id., at 480. The final option,
we noted, was already in effect: By the time Siegel reached
our Court, Congress had replaced the permissive “may” in the fee
statute with a mandatory “shall,” resulting in equal fees for
U. S. Trustee and Bankruptcy Administrator districts as of
April 2021. Id., at 471 (quoting Pub. L. 116–325, §3(d)(2),
134Stat. 5088). But, because the remedial question had not been
passed on below, we remanded for the Fourth Circuit to address it
in the first instance. See Siegel, 596 U. S., at
481.

															C

															As in Siegel, this case arises from a
Chapter 11 case filed in a U. S. Trustee district. Cf.
id., at 471. In 2016, a group of 76 legal entities related
to a chain of hotels and resorts filed for bankruptcy in the
District of Kansas. Starting in January 2018, the debtors were
subjected to increased quarterly fees under the amended fee
statute. In March 2020, the debtors challenged the
constitutionality of those fees, seeking both a refund of fees
already paid and a reversion of future fees to their 2017 level.
See Debtors’ Motion To Determine Extent of Liability for Quarterly
Fees Payable in No. 16–21142 (Bkrtcy. Ct. Kan., Mar. 3, 2020),
ECF Doc. 2823. Finding no constitutional violation, the Bankruptcy
Court did not reach the remedial question. See In re John
Q. Hammons Fall 2006, LLC, 618 B.R. 519, 525–526 (Kan.
2020).

															The Tenth Circuit reversed. See In re
John Q. Hammons Fall 2006, LLC, 15 F. 4th 1011, 1016
(2021). It anticipated our holding in Siegel and found that
the fee statute permitting nonuniform fees violated the Bankruptcy
Clause. See id., at 1025. To remedy that violation, the
panel then ordered a refund of the debtors’ quarterly fees so that
they equaled the lower fees the debtors would have paid had their
case been filed in a Bankruptcy Administrator district. See
id., at 1025–1026. The U. S. Trustee sought certiorari.
After deciding Siegel, we granted the petition, vacated the
Tenth Circuit’s judgment, and remanded for further consideration.
596 U. S. ___ (2022). The Tenth Circuit sought supplemental
briefing, but ultimately reinstated its original opinion without
alteration. See In re John Q. Hammons Fall 2006, LLC,
2022 WL 3354682, *1 (Aug. 15, 2022). After rehearing was denied,
the U. S. Trustee again petitioned for review.

															We granted certiorari to answer the remedial
question left open in Siegel. 600 U. S. ___ (2023).

															II

															Across remedial contexts, “the nature of the
violation determines the scope of the remedy.” Swann v.
Charlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. of Ed., 402 U.S.
1, 16 (1971); see also Ayotte v. Planned Parenthood
of Northern New Eng., 546 U.S.
320, 328 (2006) (“Generally speaking, when confronting a
constitutional flaw in a statute, we try to limit the solution to
the problem”). Accordingly, before we can determine the appropriate
remedy for the Bankruptcy Clause violation in this case, we must
bear down upon the particulars of the constitutional violation we
identified in Siegel. Three aspects of our holding are worth
highlighting.

															First, the violation we identified was
nonuniformity, not high fees. There was no doubt raised in
Siegel about Congress’s power to raise fees for large
Chapter 11 debtors. The constitutional issue arose only because the
fee statute’s permissive language effectively “exempted debtors in”
Bankruptcy Administrator districts from paying the new rates,
resulting in a disparity in fees between the two types of
bankruptcy districts. Siegel, 596 U. S., at 468. Though
respondents understandably complain about their higher payments,
our task is not necessarily to reduce them; it is to remedy the
disparity.[1]

															Second, the fee disparity at issue here was
short lived. It began in January 2018. By October 2018, the
Judicial Conference required newly filed Chapter 11 cases in
Bankruptcy Administrator districts to pay the higher fees. And
starting in April 2021, Congress required uniform fees for pending
cases too. Due to these policy shifts by the Judicial Conference
and Congress, a large Chapter 11 debtor was subject to, at most,
three years and three months of nonuniform treatment.

															Finally, the disparity was small. The Government
estimates (and respondents do not dispute) that, during the
relevant period, only about 50 out of the more than 2,000 cases
involving large Chapter 11 debtors were filed in Bankruptcy
Administrator districts—a mere 2%. See Brief for Petitioner 11;
Reply Brief 16–19. Therefore, even when the statute
unconstitutionally permitted the complained-of fee disparity, 98%
of the relevant class of debtors still paid uniform fees.

															In short, the constitutional violation we
identified in Siegel created a monetary disparity in
bankruptcy fees that was short lived and small. With the limited
nature of the constitutional problem in mind, we now turn to the
question of how to remedy it.

															III

															A

															“[T]he touchstone for any decision about
remedy is legislative intent.” Ayotte, 546 U. S., at
330. Thus, the key question in determining how to remedy a
constitutional violation wrought by the legislative process is
always “ ‘what the legislature would have willed had it been
apprised of the constitutional infirmity.’ ” Sessions
v. Morales-Santana, 582 U.S. 47, 73–74 (2017) (quoting
Levin v. Commerce Energy, Inc., 560 U.S.
413, 427 (2010)). In cases involving unequal treatment,
answering this question generally leads to a focus on two
considerations: Congress’s “ ‘ “intensity of
commitment” ’ ” to the more broadly applicable rule, and
“ ‘ “the degree of potential disruption of the statutory
scheme that would occur” ’ ” if we were to extend the
exception. Morales-Santana, 582 U. S., at 75 (quoting
Heckler v. Mathews, 465 U.S.
728, 739, n. 5 (1984)). In light of our limited
institutional competence, we are also cognizant that Congress
likely would not have intended relief that is impractical or
unworkable. See, e.g., Seila Law LLC v.
Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, 591 U.S. 197, 236–237
(2020) (opinion of Roberts, C. J.); Los Angeles Dept. of
Water and Power v. Manhart, 435
U.S. 702, 718–723 (1978). And we must keep in mind that our
ultimate aim is to remedy the constitutional wrong consistent with
congressional intent, not to provide the complaining parties’
preferred form of relief. See, e.g., Barr v.
American Assn. of Political Consultants, Inc., 591 U.S. 610,
634–635 (2020) (opinion of Kavanaugh, J.); Morales-Santana,
582 U. S., at 77, n. 29.

															As respondents acknowledge, “Congress’s
intentions here were unmistakable.” Brief for Respondents 31. Faced
with the constitutional violation we identified in Siegel,
Congress would have wanted prospective parity, not a refund or
retrospective raising of fees. In other words, to remedy the fee
disparity, Congress would have wanted to impose equal fees in all
districts going forward. This conclusion is clear from the
intensity of Congress’s commitment to raising fees in U. S.
Trustee districts, the extreme disruption a refund would cause to
the bankruptcy system, and Congress’s own decision to remedy the
wrong we face by imposing equal fees going forward. We discuss each
of these considerations in turn.

															Start with Congress’s commitment to higher fees
in U. S. Trustee districts. Congress designed the U. S.
Trustee Program to “be funded in its entirety by user fees.”
Siegel, 596 U. S., at 469. Chapter 11 cases play a
central role in achieving that goal. Congress required 100% of
Chapter 11 quarterly fees to be deposited in the U. S.
Trustee’s operating fund. §589a(b)(5).[2] By 2017, almost two-thirds of the U. S. Trustee
Program’s funding came from Chapter 11 fees alone. See H. R.
Rep. No. 115–130, p. 7, n. 26 (2017). It is not
surprising, then, that when there was a funding shortfall for the
U. S. Trustee Program, Congress chose to address it by raising
fees on the largest Chapter 11 debtors. See Siegel, 596
U. S., at 470.

															In 2021, when Congress amended the fee statute,
it removed any doubts about its commitment to raising fees in order
to keep the U. S. Trustee Program self-funded. The statute
specifically stated that the purpose of keeping fees at an elevated
level was “to further the long-standing goal of Congress of
ensuring that the bankruptcy system is self-funded, at no cost to
the taxpayer.” 2021 Act §2(b); see also §2(a)(1). Respondents point
to nothing—in the history of the bankruptcy system, the design of
the U. S. Trustee Program, or the 2017 or 2021 Acts—that cuts
against Congress’s stated commitment to having higher fees for
large Chapter 11 debtors in U. S. Trustee districts.

															Now consider the flipside of this clear
congressional commitment: the disruption that would follow from
granting respondents’ request to refund their fees. Our imposition
of a refund would significantly undermine Congress’s goal of
keeping the U. S. Trustee Program self-funded. Respondents do
not dispute that refunding all large Chapter 11 debtors in
U. S. Trustee districts would be expensive; the Government
estimates it would cost approximately $326 million. See Brief for
Petitioner 35–36; see also Brief for Respondents 21, and n. 6.
If the Government’s estimate is even close to correct, the cost of
the refund would greatly exceed the $200 million threshold Congress
selected in 2017 to signal fiscal distress in the U. S.
Trustee Program and trigger higher fees. See Siegel, 596
U. S., at 470–471. Thus, in mandating such a remedy, we would
transform a program Congress designed to be self-funding into an
enormous bill for taxpayers. It is hard to imagine a remedy more
diametrically opposed to clear congressional intent.

															On top of that, respondents’ proposed refund
would almost certainly exacerbate the small fee disparity we are
attempting to remedy. As already noted, respondents are among the
98% of large Chapter 11 debtors who paid higher fees starting in
2018, just as Congress wanted. By refunding them, we would add to
the past nonuniformity by increasing the tiny percentage of
debtors—currently 2%—who paid lower fees. As the Government aptly
notes, even if 95% of the debtors in U. S. Trustee districts
that paid higher fees received a refund, we would still end up
creating a greater overall disparity than what resulted from
Congress’s requirement of prospective parity. See Brief for
Petitioner 40.

															Of course, it is true that the disparity could
be entirely eliminated if all the debtors who paid higher fees were
given a refund. But that theoretical possibility blinks reality.
The Government estimates that 85% of the large Chapter 11 cases
subject to higher fees between January 2018 and April 2021 have
closed, and some of those debtors have been liquidated or otherwise
ceased to exist. See Reply Brief 20. Respondents offer no
meaningful path to reducing the small existing disparity through
refunds. Instead, they encourage us to defy congressional intent,
disrupt the U. S. Trustee Program’s self-funding mandate, and
divert the attendant costs to taxpayers—all to give them a remedy
that will make the disparity caused by the constitutional violation
worse.

															The only real question, then, is whether
Congress would have wanted to retrospectively impose higher fees on
debtors in Bankruptcy Administrator districts. The best evidence
that Congress did not intend such a remedy is that Congress itself
chose not to pursue that course. In the 2021 Act, as respondents
acknowledge, “Congress revised the fee scheme to address this very
issue, and it did so by mandating equal fees prospectively
only.” Brief for Respondents 31 (citing Pub. L. 116–325,
§§3(d)(2), 3(e)(2)(B), 134Stat. 5088–5089); see also 28
U. S. C. §1930(a)(6)(B)(ii)(II).

															Congress’s choice makes sense. Because fees
collected in Bankruptcy Administrator districts go toward
offsetting the Judiciary’s appropriation, not to supporting the
U. S. Trustee Program, retrospectively raising fees in
Bankruptcy Administrator districts would do nothing to achieve
Congress’s goal of keeping the U. S. Trustee Program
self-funding. See §1930(a)(7). Thus, with the 2021 Act, Congress
evinced a clear desire to comply with the constitutional mandate of
uniformity by requiring prospective parity, but it reasonably chose
not to impose higher fees retrospectively in Bankruptcy
Administrator districts.

															What is more, there are serious practical
challenges to a retrospective imposition of higher fees. As in
U. S. Trustee districts, many of the debtors who paid lower
fees in Bankruptcy Administrator districts have exited bankruptcy
or ceased to exist. See Brief for Respondents 38–39. Indeed, the
Government estimates that only 10 of the roughly 50 cases involving
debtors who paid lower fees are still open. See Reply Brief 17–18.
Moreover, locating all the former debtors or their successors would
not end the practical problems. The Government would be forced to
extract fees from funds that might already be disbursed, inevitably
prompting additional litigation and even the unwinding of closed
cases. See ibid. And all that effort would be directed
against parties who followed the law and complied with the fee
schedule imposed by the Judicial Conference under the 2017 Act.

															Our remedial principles do not require us to
follow that unintended, impractical course. Faced with far more
serious dignitary harms than those implicated by a small and
short-lived disparity in bankruptcy fees for large debtors, we have
deemed prospective parity sufficient to remedy unconstitutional
differences in treatment. See Heckler, 465 U. S., at
740, n. 8 (“[W]e have often recognized that the victims of a
discriminatory government program may be remedied by an end to the
preferential treatment for others”); see also, e.g.,
Morales-Santana, 582 U. S., at 77 (sex discrimination);
Manhart, 435 U. S., at 721 (same). Here, Congress would
have wanted prospective parity, and that remedy is sufficient to
address the small, short-lived disparity caused by the
constitutional violation we identified in Siegel.

															B

															The dissent offers three primary responses to
our analysis thus far. First, the dissent argues that congressional
intent is irrelevant, and we should simply defer to the plaintiffs’
request for damages. See post, at 9, 11 (opinion of Gorsuch,
J.). For their part, respondents do not claim that this is how our
remedial precedent works; as already noted, they agree that “courts
crafting constitutional remedies consult ‘the legislature’s
intent.’ ” Brief for Respondents 31 (quoting
Morales-Santana, 582 U. S., at 73). That’s for good
reason: The dissent’s argument turns on a misapprehension of the
constitutional wrong at issue here. The remedial question before us
is not whether to pay damages or not; it is how to address a
short-lived and small disparity. “How equality is accomplished—by
extension or invalidation of the unequally distributed benefit or
burden, or some other measure—is a matter on which the Constitution
is silent.” Levin, 560 U. S., at 426–427. So, when seeking
to remedy an unconstitutional disparity, rather than divining the
right answer ourselves or picking a party’s preferred form of
relief (which may, as in this case, make the disparity worse), we
generally look to the intent of the Legislature. See id., at
427–428.

															Second, the dissent argues that, if we are to
rely on congressional intent, it actually points to a refund. See
post, at 13–14. For support, the dissent cites only to the
fiscal year 2020 appropriations law. See post, at 13 (citing
133Stat. 2398). But, again, there is a reason that respondents do
not advance this argument; in fact, they concede that “Congress
. . . address[ed] this very issue” and mandated
prospective equalization of fees. Brief for Respondents 31. The
dissent cites boilerplate language that simply allows the
U. S. Trustee to respond effectively to commonplace
overpayments by debtors. See Pub. L. 116–93, 133Stat. 2398
(“[D]eposits . . . and amounts herein appropriated shall
be available in such amounts as may be necessary to pay refunds due
depositors”). Such statements have been part of every
appropriations law for years, including before the disparity at
issue here came into existence. See, e.g., 131Stat.
195 (2017 appropriations law); 129Stat. 2298 (2016 appropriations
law). Far from confirming a congressional intent to authorize an
estimated $326 million refund here, the broader provision the
dissent invokes underscores that a refund would send the U. S.
Trustee Program into fiscal freefall, contradicting Congress’s
intent to have the program be self-funding. See 133Stat. 2398
(estimating fee revenue and structuring appropriations “so as to
result in a final fiscal year 2020 appropriation from the general
fund estimated at $0”).

															Finally, the dissent suggests we need not
address congressional intent at all, because the Government
actually promised these respondents a refund. See,
e.g., post, at 1, 5–7, 18–19, n. 7. Once
again, the dissent relies on an argument respondents have not
advanced in this Court. And, once again, the dissent might have
done better following respondents’ cue. The relied-upon passage in
the Government’s bankruptcy court filing is nothing more than a
request by the Government not to be forced to provide any remedy
until after it has exhausted all appeals. See Objection of the
United States to Debtor’s Motion To Determine Extent of Liability
for Quarterly Fees Payable in No. 16–21142 (Bkrtcy. Ct. Kan., Apr.
27, 2020), ECF Doc. 2868, pp. 59–61. Read fairly, the
Government promised only what you would expect: that it would
comply with a final judgment. See ibid.; see also Reply
Brief 7, n. 1 (“Although the government does not believe a
refund is the appropriate remedy, if it is subject to a judgment
directing it to pay a refund, it will of course comply”).

															In sum, while the dissent invents new arguments
to arrive at its favored outcome, we prefer to stick with the
parties and our controlling precedent.[3]

															IV

															Respondents and the dissent ask us to override
Congress’s clear intent because, they claim, due process requires
it. See post, at 14–18. To advance this argument, they rely
on a series of cases involving unconstitutional state taxes. See,
e.g., McKesson Corp. v. Division of
Alcoholic Beverages and Tobacco, Fla. Dept. of Business
Regulation, 496 U.S.
18 (1990); Harper v. Virginia Dept. of Taxation,
509 U.S.
86 (1993); Reich v. Collins, 513 U.S.
106 (1994); Newsweek, Inc. v. Florida Dept. of
Revenue, 522 U.S. 442 (1998) (per curiam). In
respondents’ view, these cases stand for the proposition that “due
process requires ‘meaningful backward-looking relief ’ unless
an ‘exclusive’ predeprivation remedy is both ‘clear and
certain.’ ” Brief for Respondents 22 (first quoting Brief for
Petitioner 29, in turn quoting McKesson, 496 U. S., at
31, then quoting Newsweek, 522 U. S., at 443–444;
capitalization and boldface deleted). Respondents claim that
because the predeprivation remedy here was neither exclusive nor
clear and certain, they are entitled to a refund. See Brief for
Respondents 22–28.

															We disagree. To start, we note that the tax
cases arrived at their holdings only after scrutinizing close to a
century of tax-specific jurisprudence and carefully analyzing the
unique interests the taxation context involves, including the
Government’s “exceedingly strong interest in financial stability”
and the attendant need for prompt payment and postdeprivation
protections. See McKesson, 496 U. S., at 37; see also
id., at 32–38. The dissent does not dispute this, nor does
it adequately explain why we deemed such history and context so
central to our holdings in the tax cases. See post, at
17–18. For their part, respondents simply ignore this context
entirely. Instead, they replace the word “tax” with “fee,” see
Brief for Respondents 22, and assert that the constitutional
holding of the tax cases applies to any case involving “monetary
injury,” including those arising from the voluntary,
fee-for-service bankruptcy system, id., at 9.

															No matter, though. Even assuming that the tax
cases apply, respondents are not entitled to relief under them. We
held in those cases that if there was “ ‘a meaningful
opportunity for taxpayers to withhold contested tax assessments and
to challenge their validity in a predeprivation hearing,’ the
‘availability of a predeprivation hearing constitute[d] a
procedural safeguard . . . sufficient by itself to
satisfy the Due Process Clause.’ ” Harper, 509
U. S., at 101 (quoting McKesson, 496 U. S., at 38,
n. 21). Here, respondents acknowledge that they had the
opportunity to challenge their fees before they paid them. See
Brief for Respondents 25 (“[T]he same bankruptcy procedures are
open and available before or after paying an invalid fee. Both are
equally acceptable for a party to assert and preserve its rights”).
Under the tax cases, then, respondents are not entitled to any
particular remedy.

															Respondents and the dissent misread our later
decisions as displacing that basic holding. In subsequent cases, we
addressed situations where a State “reconfigure[d] its scheme,
unfairly, in mid-course—to ‘bait and switch’ ”
taxpayers out of a refund remedy guaranteed under state law.
Reich, 513 U. S., at 111; see also Newsweek, 522
U. S., at 444. We held that States could not hold open a
postdeprivation refund remedy to encourage payment and then take it
away after taxpayers paid. See Reich, 513 U. S., at
111–112; Newsweek, 522 U. S., at 444–445. In this case,
though, there was neither a guaranteed refund remedy nor a bait and
switch. Nothing in the Bankruptcy Code promises a refund to those
who successfully challenge their fees. And respondents point to no
previously available statutory remedy of which the Government has
now deprived them. So those later cases do not help respondents
either.

															With all that said, nothing we say here should
be taken to diminish or depart from the holdings of the tax cases
as they apply in the tax context. Nor do we mean to suggest that
congressional intent is an entirely unchecked guide in our remedial
analysis for constitutional violations. We cannot remedy an old
constitutional problem by creating a new one, so due process and
other constitutional protections undoubtedly will limit the
possible remedies in many cases. See Barr, 591 U. S.,
at 633. Here, though, due process does not mandate any particular
remedy. Therefore, as the tax cases themselves advise, we must,
“within the bounds of [our] institutional competence,
. . . implement what the legislature would have willed.”
Levin, 560 U. S., at 427.

															Faced with the unconstitutional nonuniformity
we recognized in Siegel, Congress would have provided for
uniform fees going forward. That remedy cures the constitutional
violation, and due process does not require another result. The
judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit is reversed,
and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with
this opinion.

															

															It is so ordered.

Notes
1
 Notably, even with the
2017 Act’s increase, large Chapter 11 debtors in U. S. Trustee
districts often paid lower fees, relative to their disbursements,
than much smaller debtors. For example, fees for those with
disbursements over $1 million, like respondents, were capped at 1%
of disbursements, while fees for those debtors disbursing $15,000
or less were set at a flat rate of $325, for a minimum of about
2.2%. See §1004(a)(2), 131Stat. 1232, 28 U. S. C.
§1930(a)(6)(A).

 As part of the 2017 Act,
Congress committed 98% of the money that the fee increase generated
to funding the U. S. Trustee Program; the remaining 2% was
deposited in the general fund of the Treasury. See §1004, 131Stat.
1232.

 The dissent attempts, in
various additional ways, to cabin, qualify, or contradict our
analysis, including by wrongly suggesting that it rests on the
party presentation principle. See post, at 13, n. 4.
Readers are reminded that the dissent is “just that.” National
