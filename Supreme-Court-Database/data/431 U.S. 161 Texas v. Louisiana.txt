															IT IS ORDERED, ADJUDGED AND DECREED As FOLLOWS:

															1. That the extension of the boundary southerly from the point
where the line forming the boundary between Texas and Louisiana
southerly from the Arkansas boundary, intersects the geographical
middle of the Sabine River (Latitude 31�59' 56.225" North,
Longitude 94�02'33.105" West, said point being taken from the
United States Geological Survey Quadrangle Center, Tex.-La. 1958
Edition) to the mid-point between the gulfward extension of the
Sabine Pass jetties Latitude 29�38'37.329" North, Longitude
93�49'30.940" West hereby is established.

															Said boundary commences at Latitude 31�59'56.225" North and
Longitude 94�02'33.105" West, thence proceeding in a southerly
direction along the Sabine River using the federal line as shown
for the boundary on the United States Geological Survey Quadrangle

North, Longitude 93�49' 30.940" West (end of jetties) is a line
running South-Southeasterly from said point on a constant bearing
of South 13�44' 45.8" east true to the seaward limit of Louisiana's
Submerged Lands Act grant. Texas' historic boundary then continues
offshore on the same bearing to the point Latitude 29�32' 06.784"
North, Longitude 93�47' 41.699" West. This offshore lateral
boundary and the Texas historical boundary are shown upon Exhibit
14 which is in evidence in this case.

															3. That the United States holds no title to or interest in any
island in the west half of the Sabine River by virtue of that
island's continuous existence since 1848, when the western half of
that River was part of the territory of the United States, but not
part of Texas. Louisiana does not hold title to or interest in any
island in the west half of the Sabine River. The United States and
Texas do not hold title to or interest in any island in the east
half of the Sabine River.

															4. That Exhibits 1-14, in evidence herein and above mentioned,
be certified by the Special Master as delineating the

															Page 431 U. S. 168

															boundary between the State of Texas and the State of Louisiana,
from Latitude 32� North, as defined herein, to the seaward limits
of Louisiana's Submerged Land Act grant, and the seaward limits of
Texas' historical boundary, as defined herein, and that the State
of Louisiana be directed to deposit a copy of these maps, so
certified by the Special Master, along with a certified copy of
this decree, with the Register of the State Land Office for the
State of Louisiana, and that the State of Texas be directed to
deposit a set of these maps, so certified by the Special Master,
along with a certified copy of this decree, with the Commissioner
of the General Land Office of the State of Texas.

															5. That the costs be taxed to the parties in accordance with
their contribution to the fund established by the Special Master,
and that no costs be taxed for the services of the Special
Master.

															6. That any unexpended funds contributed by the parties to the
Special Master for necessary expenses be returned to the
parties.

															7. That, upon such return of funds, the Honorable Robert Van
Pelt, the Special Master appointed in this cause, will have
completed his duties, and is thereupon discharged.
