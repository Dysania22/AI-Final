															SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

															_________________

															No. 13–975

															_________________

															T-MOBILE SOUTH, LLC, PETITIONER v.CITY OF ROSWELL,
GEORGIA

															on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for
the eleventh circuit

															[January 14, 2015]

															Justice Alito, concurring.

															I concur in the Court’s opinion because I agree that Congress,
by using the term “substantial evidence,” intended to invoke
administrative law principles. One such principle, as the Court
explains, is the requirement that agencies give reasons. I write
separately, however, because three other traditional administrative
law principles may also apply.

															First, a court must “uphold a decision of less than ideal
clarity if the agency’s path may reasonably be discerned.”
Bowman Transp., Inc. v. Arkansas-Best Freight System,
Inc.,419 U. S. 281,286 (1974). In the context of47
U. S. C. §332(c)(7), which leaves in place almost the
entirety of a local government’s authority, a succinct statement
that a permit has been denied because the tower would be
esthetically incompatible with the surrounding area should suffice.
Nothing in this statute imposes an opinion-writing requirement.

															Second, even if a locality has erred, a court must not
invalidate the locality’s decision if the error was harmless. “In
administrative law, as in federal civil and criminal litigation,
there is a harmless error rule.” National Assn. of Home
Builders v. Defenders of Wildlife,551 U. S. 644–660
(2007) (internal quotation marks omitted). Here, for instance, I
have trouble believing that T-Mobile South, LLC—which actively
participated in the decisionmaking process, including going so far
as to transcribe the public hearing—was prejudiced by the city of
Roswell’s delay in providing a copy of the minutes.

															Third, the ordinary rule in administrative law is that a court
must remand errors to the agency “except in rare circumstances.”
Florida Power & Light Co. v. Lorion,470
U. S. 729,744 (1985). Nothing we say today should be read to
suggest that when a locality has erred, the inevitable remedy is
that a tower must be built. The Court has not passed on what
remedial powers a “court of competent jurisdiction” may exercise.
§332(c)(7)(B)(v). This unanswered question is important given the
federalism implications of this statute.

															I do not understand the Court’s opinion to disagree with this
analysis. On that understanding, I join the Court’s opinion.
