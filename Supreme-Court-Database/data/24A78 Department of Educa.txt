															MIGUEL CARDONA, SECRETARY OF EDUCATION,
et al. v. TENNESSEE, et al.

															on application for stay

															[August 16, 2024]

															Per Curiam.

															The application for a partial stay presented to
Justice Alito in No. 24A78 and by him referred to the Court is
denied. The application for a partial stay presented to Justice
Kavanaugh in No. 24A79 and by him referred to the Court is
denied.

															The Department of Education recently issued a
new rule implementing Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972.
The rule newly defined sex discrimination to “includ[e ]
discrimination on the basis of sex stereotypes, sex
characteristics, pregnancy or related conditions, sexual
orientation, and gender identity.” 89 Fed. Reg. 33886 (2024).

															Several States and other parties sought
preliminary injunctions against the new rule, arguing among other
things that the rule exceeded the bounds of the statutory text
enacted by Congress. District Courts in Louisiana and Kentucky
agreed with the plaintiffs and preliminarily enjoined enforcement
of the rule in the plaintiff States. The Courts of Appeals for the
Fifth and Sixth Circuits then declined to stay the injunctions in
the interim period while those courts consider the Government’s
appeals of the preliminary injunctions.

															The Government has now filed emergency
applications in this Court seeking partial stays of the preliminary
injunctions pending resolution of the appeals in the Fifth and
Sixth Circuits. The Court denies the Government’s applications.

															Importantly, all Members of the Court today
accept that the plaintiffs were entitled to preliminary injunctive
relief as to three provisions of the rule, including the central
provision that newly defines sex discrimination to include
discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender
identity. But the Government argues (and the dissent agrees) that
those provisions should be severed and that the other provisions of
the new rule should still be permitted to take effect in the
interim period while the Government’s appeals of the preliminary
injunctions are pending in the Courts of Appeals. The lower courts
concluded otherwise because the new definition of sex
discrimination is intertwined with and affects many other
provisions of the new rule. Those courts therefore concluded, at
least at this preliminary stage, that the allegedly unlawful
provisions are not readily severable from the remaining provisions.
The lower courts also pointed out the difficulty that schools would
face in determining how to apply the rule for a temporary period
with some provisions in effect and some enjoined.

															In this emergency posture in this Court, the
burden is on the Government as applicant to show, among other
things, a likelihood of success on its severability argument and
that the equities favor a stay. On this limited record and in its
emergency applications, the Government has not provided this Court
a sufficient basis to disturb the lower courts’ interim conclusions
that the three provisions found likely to be unlawful are
intertwined with and affect other provisions of the rule. Nor has
the Government adequately identified which particular provisions,
if any, are sufficiently independent of the enjoined definitional
provision and thus might be able to remain in effect. Moreover,
related to the equities, the Sixth Circuit has already expedited
its consideration of the case and scheduled oral argument for
October. The Court expects that the Courts of Appeals will render
their decisions with appropriate dispatch. In light of all of the
circumstances, the Court denies the Government’s applications for
partial stays.

															It is so ordered.
