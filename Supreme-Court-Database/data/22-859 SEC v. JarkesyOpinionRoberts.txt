															Securities and Exchange Commission, PETITIONER
v. George R. Jarkesy, Jr., et al.

															on writ of certiorari to the united states
court of appeals for the fifth circuit

															[June 27, 2024]

															

															Chief Justice Roberts delivered the opinion of
the Court.

															In 2013, the Securities and Exchange Commission
initiated an enforcement action against respondents George Jarkesy,
Jr., and Patriot28, LLC, seeking civil penalties for alleged
securities fraud. The SEC chose to adjudicate the matter in-house
before one of its administrative law judges, rather than in federal
court where respondents could have proceeded before a jury. We
consider whether the Seventh Amendment permits the SEC to compel
respondents to defend themselves before the agency rather than
before a jury in federal court.

															I

															A

															In the aftermath of the Wall Street Crash of
1929, Congress passed a suite of laws designed to combat securities
fraud and increase market transparency. Three such statues are
relevant here: The Securities Act of 1933, the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. 48Stat. 74,
15 U. S. C. §§77a et seq.; 48 Stat. 881, 78a
et seq.; 54Stat. 847, 80b–1 et seq. These Acts
respectively govern the registration of securities, the trading of
securities, and the activities of investment advisers. Their
protections are mutually reinforcing and often overlap. See
Lorenzo v. SEC, 587 U.S. 71, 80 (2019). Although each
regulates different aspects of the securities markets, their
pertinent provisions—collectively referred to by regulators as “the
antifraud provisions,” App. to Pet. for Cert. 73a, 202a—target the
same basic behavior: misrepresenting or concealing material
facts.

															The three antifraud provisions are Section 17(a)
of the Securities Act, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange
Act, and Section 206 of the Investment Advisers Act. Section 17(a)
prohibits regulated individuals from “obtain[ing] money or property
by means of any untrue statement of a material fact,” as well as
causing certain omissions of material fact. 15 U. S. C.
§77q(a)(2). As implemented by Rule 10b–5, Section 10(b) prohibits
using “any device, scheme, or artifice to defraud,” making “untrue
statement[s] of . . . material fact,” causing certain
material omissions, and “engag[ing] in any act . . .
which operates or would operate as a fraud.” 17 CFR §240.10b–5
(2023); see 15 U. S. C. §78j(b). And finally, Section
206(b), as implemented by Rule 206(4)–8, prohibits investment
advisers from making “any untrue statement of a material fact” or
engaging in “fraudulent, deceptive, or manipulative” acts with
respect to investors or prospective investors. 17 CFR
§§275.206(4)–8(a)(1), (2); see 15 U. S. C. §80b–6(4).

															To enforce these Acts, Congress created the SEC.
The SEC may bring an enforcement action in one of two forums.
First, the Commission can adjudicate the matter itself. See
§§77h–1, 78u–2, 78u–3, 80b–3. Alternatively, it can file a suit in
federal court. See §§77t, 78u, 80b–9. The SEC’s choice of forum
dictates two aspects of the litigation: The procedural protections
enjoyed by the defendant, and the remedies available to the
SEC.

															Procedurally, these forums differ in who
presides and makes legal determinations, what evidentiary and
discovery rules apply, and who finds facts. Most pertinently, in
federal court a jury finds the facts, depending on the nature of
the claim. See U. S. Const., Amdt. 7. In addition, a
life-tenured, salary-protected Article III judge presides, see
Art. III, §1, and the litigation is governed by the Federal
Rules of Evidence and the ordinary rules of discovery.

															Conversely, when the SEC adjudicates the matter
in-house, there are no juries. Instead, the Commission presides and
finds facts while its Division of Enforcement prosecutes the case.
The Commission may also delegate its role as judge and factfinder
to one of its members or to an administrative law judge (ALJ) that
it employs. See 15 U. S. C. §78d–1. In these proceedings,
the Commission or its delegee decides discovery disputes, see,
e.g., 17 CFR §201.232(b), and the SEC’s Rules of
Practice govern, see 17 CFR §201.100 et seq. The
Commission or its delegee also determines the scope and form of
permissible evidence and may admit hearsay and other testimony that
would be inadmissible in federal court. See §§201.320, 201.326.

															When a Commission member or an ALJ presides, the
full Commission can review that official’s findings and
conclusions, but it is not obligated to do so. See §201.360; 15
U. S. C. §78d–1. Judicial review is also available once
the proceedings have concluded. See §§77i(a), 78y(a)(1), 80b–13(a).
But such review is deferential. By law, a reviewing court must
treat the agency’s factual findings as “conclusive” if sufficiently
supported by the record, e.g., §78y(a)(4); see
Richardson v. Perales, 402 U.S.
389, 401 (1971), even when they rest on evidence that could not
have been admitted in federal court.

															The remedy at issue in this case, civil
penalties, also originally depended upon the forum chosen by the
SEC. Except in cases against registered entities, the SEC could
obtain civil penalties only in federal court. See Insider Trading
Sanctions Act of 1984, §2, 98Stat. 1264; Securities Enforcement
Remedies and Penny Stock Reform Act of 1990, §§101, 201–202,
104Stat. 932–933, 935–938. That is no longer so. In 2010, Congress
passed the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection
Act (Dodd-Frank Act), 124Stat. 1376. That Act “ma[de] the SEC’s
authority in administrative penalty proceedings coextensive with
its authority to seek penalties in Federal court.” H. R. Rep. No.
111–687, p. 78 (2010). In other words, the SEC may now seek
civil penalties in federal court, or it may impose them through its
own in-house proceedings. See Dodd-Frank Act, §929P(a), 124Stat.
1862–1864 (codified in relevant part as amended at 15
U. S. C. §§77h–1(g), 78u–2(a), 80b–3(i)(1)).

															Civil penalties rank among the SEC’s most potent
enforcement tools. These penalties consist of fines of up to
$725,000 per violation. See §§77h–1(g), 78u–2, 80b–3(i). And the
SEC may levy these penalties even when no investor has actually
suffered financial loss. See SEC v. Blavin, 760 F.2d
706, 711 (CA6 1985) (per curiam).

															B

															Shortly after passage of the Dodd-Frank Act,
the SEC began investigating Jarkesy and Patriot28 for securities
fraud. Between 2007 and 2010, Jarkesy launched two investment
funds, raising about $24 million from 120 “accredited” investors—a
class of investors that includes, for example, financial
institutions, certain investment professionals, and high net worth
individuals. App. to Pet. for Cert. 72a–73a, 110a, n. 72; see
17 CFR §230.501. Patriot28, which Jarkesy managed, served as the
funds’ investment adviser. According to the SEC, Jarkesy and
Patriot28 misled investors in at least three ways: (1) by
misrepresenting the investment strategies that Jarkesy and
Patriot28 employed, (2) by lying about the identity of the funds’
auditor and prime broker, and (3) by inflating the funds’ claimed
value so that Jarkesy and Patriot28 could collect larger management
fees. App. to Pet. for Cert. 80a–86a, 95a–105a. The SEC initiated
an enforcement action, contending that these actions violated the
antifraud provisions of the Securities Act, the Securities Exchange
Act, and the Investment Advisers Act, and sought civil penalties
and other remedies.

															Relying on the new authority conferred by the
Dodd-Frank Act, the SEC opted to adjudicate the matter itself
rather than in federal court. In 2014, the presiding ALJ issued an
initial decision. Id., at 155a–225a. The SEC reviewed the
decision and then released its final order in 2020. Id., at
71a–154a. The final order levied a civil penalty of $300,000
against Jarkesy and Patriot28, directed them to cease and desist
committing or causing violations of the antifraud provisions,
ordered Patriot28 to disgorge earnings, and prohibited Jarkesy from
participating in the securities industry and in offerings of penny
stocks. Id., at 152a–154a.

															Jarkesy and Patriot28 petitioned for judicial
review. 34 F. 4th 446, 450 (CA5 2022). A divided panel of the
Fifth Circuit granted their petition and vacated the final order.
Id., at 449–450. Applying a two-part test from
Granfinanciera, S. A. v. Nordberg, 492 U.S.
33 (1989), the panel held that the agency’s decision to
adjudicate the matter in-house violated Jarkesy’s and Patriot28’s
Seventh Amendment right to a jury trial. 34 F. 4th, at 451. First,
the panel determined that because these SEC antifraud claims were
“akin to [a] traditional action[ ] in debt,” a jury trial
would be required if this case were brought in an Article III
court. Id., at 454; see id., at 453–455. It then
considered whether the “public rights” exception applied. That
exception permits Congress, under certain circumstances, to assign
an action to an agency tribunal without a jury, consistent with the
Seventh Amendment. See id., at 455–459. The panel concluded
that the exception did not apply, and that therefore the case
should have been brought in federal court, where a jury could have
found the facts pertinent to the defendants’ fraud liability. Based
on this Seventh Amendment violation, the panel vacated the final
order. Id., at 459.

															It also identified two further constitutional
problems. First, it determined that Congress had violated the
nondelegation doctrine by authorizing the SEC, without adequate
guidance, to choose whether to litigate this action in an Article
III court or to adjudicate the matter itself. See id., at
459–463. The panel also found that the insulation of the SEC ALJs
from executive supervision with two layers of for-cause removal
protections violated the separation of powers. See id., at
463–466. Judge Davis dissented. Id., at 466–479. The Fifth
Circuit denied rehearing en banc, 51 F. 4th 644 (2022), and we
granted certiorari, 600 U. S. ___ (2023).

															II

															This case poses a straightforward question:
whether the Seventh Amendment entitles a defendant to a jury trial
when the SEC seeks civil penalties against him for securities
fraud. Our analysis of this question follows the approach set forth
in Granfinanciera and Tull v. United States,
481 U.S.
412 (1987). The threshold issue is whether this action
implicates the Seventh Amendment. It does. The SEC’s antifraud
provisions replicate common law fraud, and it is well established
that common law claims must be heard by a jury.

															Since this case does implicate the Seventh
Amendment, we next consider whether the “public rights” exception
to Article III jurisdiction applies. This exception has been held
to permit Congress to assign certain matters to agencies for
adjudication even though such proceedings would not afford the
right to a jury trial. The exception does not apply here because
the present action does not fall within any of the distinctive
areas involving governmental prerogatives where the Court has
concluded that a matter may be resolved outside of an Article III
court, without a jury. The Seventh Amendment therefore applies and
a jury is required. Since the answer to the jury trial question
resolves this case, we do not reach the nondelegation or removal
issues.

															A

															We first explain why this action implicates
the Seventh Amendment.

															1

															The right to trial by jury is “of such
importance and occupies so firm a place in our history and
jurisprudence that any seeming curtailment of the right” has always
been and “should be scrutinized with the utmost care.”
Dimick v. Schiedt, 293 U.S.
474, 486 (1935). Commentators recognized the right as “the
glory of the English law,” 3 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the
Laws of England 379 (8th ed. 1778) (Blackstone), and it was prized
by the American colonists. When the English began evading American
juries by siphoning adjudications to juryless admiralty, vice
admiralty, and chancery courts, Americans condemned Parliament for
“subvert[ing] the rights and liberties of the colonists.”
Resolutions of the Stamp Act Congress, Art. VIII (Oct. 19,
1765), reprinted in Sources of Our Liberties 270, 271 (R. Perry
& J. Cooper eds. 1959). Representatives gathered at the First
Continental Congress demanded that Parliament respect the “great
and inestimable privilege of being tried by their peers of the
vicinage, according to the [common] law.” 1 Journals of the
Continental Congress, 1774–1789, p. 69 (Oct. 14, 1774) (W. Ford ed.
1904). And when the English continued to try Americans without
juries, the Founders cited the practice as a justification for
severing our ties to England. See Declaration of Independence ¶20;
see generally Erlinger v. United States, 602
U. S. ___, ___–___ (2024).

															In the Revolution’s aftermath, perhaps the “most
success[ful]” critique leveled against the proposed Constitution
was its “want of a . . . provision for the trial by jury
in civil cases.” The Federalist No. 83, p. 495 (C. Rossiter ed.
1961) (A. Hamilton) (emphasis deleted). The Framers promptly
adopted the Seventh Amendment to fix that flaw. In so doing, they
“embedded” the right in the Constitution, securing it “against the
passing demands of expediency or convenience.” Reid v.
Covert, 354 U.S.
1, 10 (1957) (plurality opinion). Since then, “every
encroachment upon it has been watched with great jealousy.”
Parsons v. Bedford, 3 Pet. 433, 446 (1830).

															2

															By its text, the Seventh Amendment guarantees
that in “[s]uits at common law, . . . the right of trial
by jury shall be preserved.” In construing this language, we have
noted that the right is not limited to the “common-law forms of
action recognized” when the Seventh Amendment was ratified.
Curtis v. Loether, 415 U.S.
189, 193 (1974). As Justice Story explained, the Framers used
the term “common law” in the Amendment “in contradistinction to
equity, and admiralty, and maritime jurisprudence.” Parsons,
3 Pet., at 446. The Amendment therefore “embrace[s] all suits which
are not of equity or admiralty jurisdiction, whatever may be the
peculiar form which they may assume.” Id., at 447.

															The Seventh Amendment extends to a particular
statutory claim if the claim is “legal in nature.”
Granfinanciera, 492 U. S., at 53. As we made clear in
Tull, whether that claim is statutory is immaterial to this
analysis. See 481 U. S., at 414–415, 417–425. In that case,
the Government sued a real estate developer for civil penalties in
federal court. The developer responded by invoking his right to a
jury trial. Although the cause of action arose under the Clean
Water Act, the Court surveyed early cases to show that the
statutory nature of the claim was not legally relevant. “Actions by
the Government to recover civil penalties under statutory
provisions,” we explained, “historically ha[d] been viewed as [a]
type of action in debt requiring trial by jury.” Id., at
418–419. To determine whether a suit is legal in nature, we
directed courts to consider the cause of action and the remedy it
provides. Since some causes of action sound in both law and equity,
we concluded that the remedy was the “more important”
consideration. Id., at 421 (brackets and internal quotation
marks omitted); see id., at 418–421.

															In this case, the remedy is all but dispositive.
For respondents’ alleged fraud, the SEC seeks civil penalties, a
form of monetary relief. While monetary relief can be legal or
equitable, money damages are the prototypical common law remedy.
See Mertens v. Hewitt Associates, 508 U.S.
248, 255 (1993). What determines whether a monetary remedy is
legal is if it is designed to punish or deter the wrongdoer, or, on
the other hand, solely to “restore the status quo.” Tull,
481 U. S., at 422. As we have previously explained, “a civil
sanction that cannot fairly be said solely to serve a remedial
purpose, but rather can only be explained as also serving either
retributive or deterrent purposes, is punishment.” Austin v.
United States, 509 U.S.
602, 610 (1993) (internal quotation marks omitted). And while
courts of equity could order a defendant to return unjustly
obtained funds, only courts of law issued monetary penalties to
“punish culpable individuals.” Tull, 481 U. S., at 422.
Applying these principles, we have recognized that “civil
penalt[ies are] a type of remedy at common law that could only be
enforced in courts of law.” Ibid. The same is true here.

															To start, the Securities Exchange Act and the
Investment Advisers Act condition the availability of civil
penalties on six statutory factors: (1) whether the alleged
misconduct involved fraud, deceit, manipulation, or deliberate or
reckless disregard for regulatory requirements, (2) whether it
caused harm, (3) whether it resulted in unjust enrichment,
accounting for any restitution made, (4) whether the defendant had
previously violated securities laws or regulations, or had
previously committed certain crimes, (5) the need for deterrence,
and (6) other “matters as justice may require.” §§78u–2(c),
80b–3(i)(3). Of these, several concern culpability, deterrence, and
recidivism. Because they tie the availability of civil penalties to
the perceived need to punish the defendant rather than to restore
the victim, such considerations are legal rather than
equitable.

															The same is true of the criteria that determine
the size of the available remedy. The Securities Act, the
Securities Exchange Act, and the Investment Advisers Act establish
three “tiers” of civil penalties. See §§77h–1(g)(2), 78u–2(b),
80b–3(i)(2). Violating a federal securities law or regulation
exposes a defendant to a first tier penalty. A second tier penalty
may be ordered if the violation involved fraud, deceit,
manipulation, or deliberate or reckless disregard for regulatory
requirements. Finally, if those acts also resulted in substantial
gains to the defendant or losses to another, or created a
“significant risk” of the latter, the defendant is subject to a
third tier penalty. Each successive tier authorizes a larger
monetary sanction. See ibid.

															Like the considerations that determine the
availability of civil penalties in the first place, the criteria
that divide these tiers are also legal in nature. Each tier
conditions the available penalty on the culpability of the
defendant and the need for deterrence, not the size of the harm
that must be remedied. Indeed, showing that a victim suffered harm
is not even required to advance a defendant from one tier to the
next. Since nothing in this analysis turns on “restor[ing] the
status quo,” Tull, 481 U. S., at 422, these factors
show that these civil penalties are designed to be punitive.

															The final proof that this remedy is punitive is
that the SEC is not obligated to return any money to victims. See
id., at 422–423. Although the SEC can choose to compensate
injured shareholders from the civil penalties it collects, see 15
U. S. C. §7246(a), it admits that it is not required to
do so, see App. to Pet. for Cert. 124a, n. 116 (citing 17 CFR
§201.1100). Such a penalty by definition does not “restore the
status quo” and can make no pretense of being equitable.
Tull, 481 U. S., at 422.

															In sum, the civil penalties in this case are
designed to punish and deter, not to compensate. They are therefore
“a type of remedy at common law that could only be enforced in
courts of law.” Ibid. That conclusion effectively decides
that this suit implicates the Seventh Amendment right, and that a
defendant would be entitled to a jury on these claims. See
id., at 421–423.

															The close relationship between the causes of
action in this case and common law fraud confirms that conclusion.
Both target the same basic conduct: misrepresenting or concealing
material facts. Compare 15 U. S. C. §§77q(a)(2), 78j(b),
80b–6(4); 17 CFR §§240.10b–5(b), 275.206(4)–8(a)(1), with
Restatement (Third) of Torts: Liability for Economic Harm, §§9, 13
(2018); see also, e.g., Pauwels v. Deloitte
LLP, 83 F. 4th 171, 189–190 (CA2 2023) (identifying the
elements of common law fraud under New York law); Conroy v.
Regents of Univ. of Cal., 
45 Cal. 4th 1244, 1254–1255, 203 P.3d 1127, 1135 (2009) (same
for California law); Wesdem, L.L.C. v. Illinois Tool
Works, Inc., 70 F. 4th 285, 291 (CA5 2023) (same for Texas
law). That is no accident. Congress deliberately used “fraud” and
other common law terms of art in the Securities Act, the Securities
Exchange Act, and the Investment Advisers Act. E.g.,
15 U. S. C. §77q(a)(3) (prohibiting any practice “which
operates . . . as a fraud”). In so doing, Congress
incorporated prohibitions from common law fraud into federal
securities law. The SEC has followed suit in rulemakings. Rule
10b–5, for example, prohibits “any device, scheme, or artifice to
defraud,” and “engag[ing] in any act . . . which operates
or would operate as a fraud.” 17 CFR §§240.10b–5(a), (c).

															Congress’s decision to draw upon common law
fraud created an enduring link between federal securities fraud and
its common law “ancestor.” Foster v. Wilson, 504 F.3d
1046, 1050 (CA9 2007). “[W]hen Congress transplants a common-law
term, the old soil comes with it.” United States v.
Hansen, 599 U.S. 762, 778 (2023) (internal quotation marks
omitted). Our precedents therefore often consider common law fraud
principles when interpreting federal securities law.
E.g., Dura Pharmaceuticals, Inc. v.
Broudo, 544 U.S.
336, 343–344 (2005) (evaluating pleading requirements in light
of the “common-law roots of the securities fraud action”);
Schreiber v. Burlington Northern, Inc., 472 U.S.
1, 7 (1985) (“The meaning the Court has given the term
‘manipulative’ [in §10b of the Securities Exchange Act] is
consistent with the use of the term at common law
. . . .” (footnote omitted)); Chiarella v.
United States, 445 U.S.
222, 227–229 (1980) (explaining that insider trading liability
under Rule 10b–5 is rooted in the common law duty of disclosure);
Basic Inc. v. Levinson, 485 U.S.
224, 253 (1988) (White, J., concurring in part and dissenting
in part) (“In general, the case law developed in this Court with
respect to §10(b) and Rule 10b–5 has been based on doctrines with
which we, as judges, are familiar: common-law doctrines of fraud
and deceit.”).

															That is not to say that federal securities fraud
and common law fraud are identical. In some respects, federal
securities fraud is narrower. For example, federal securities law
does not “convert every common-law fraud that happens to involve
securities into a violation.” SEC v. Zandford,
535 U.S.
813, 820 (2002). It only targets certain subject matter and
certain disclosures. In other respects, federal securities fraud is
broader. For example, federal securities fraud employs the burden
of proof typical in civil cases, while its common law analogue
traditionally used a more stringent standard. See Herman &
MacLean v. Huddleston, 459 U.S.
375, 387–390 (1983). Courts have also not typically interpreted
federal securities fraud to require a showing of harm to be
actionable by the SEC. See, e.g., Blavin, 760 F. 2d,
at 711; SEC v. Life Partners Holdings, Inc., 854 F.3d
765, 779 (CA5 2017). Nevertheless, the close relationship between
federal securities fraud and common law fraud confirms that this
action is “legal in nature.” Granfinanciera, 492 U. S.,
at 53.

															Although the claims at issue here implicate
the Seventh Amendment, the Government and the dissent argue that a
jury trial is not required because the “public rights” exception
applies. Under this exception, Congress may assign the matter for
decision to an agency without a jury, consistent with the Seventh
Amendment. But this case does not fall within the exception, so
Congress may not avoid a jury trial by preventing the case from
being heard before an Article III tribunal.

															The Constitution prohibits Congress from
“withdraw[ing] from judicial cognizance any matter which, from its
nature, is the subject of a suit at the common law.” Murray’s
Lessee v. Hoboken Land & Improvement Co., 18 How.
272, 284 (1856). Once such a suit “is brought within the bounds of
federal jurisdiction,” an Article III court must decide it, with a
jury if the Seventh Amendment applies. Stern v.
Marshall, 564 U.S.
462, 484 (2011). These propositions are critical to maintaining
the proper role of the Judiciary in the Constitution: “Under ‘the
basic concept of separation of powers . . . that flow[s]
from the scheme of a tripartite government’ adopted in the
Constitution, ‘the judicial Power of the United States’ ”
cannot be shared with the other branches. Id., at 483
(quoting United States v. Nixon, 418 U.S.
683, 704 (1974); alteration in original). Or, as Alexander
Hamilton wrote in The Federalist Papers, “ ‘there is no
liberty if the power of judging be not separated from the
legislative and executive powers.’ ” The Federalist No. 78, at
466 (quoting 1 Montesquieu, The Spirit of Laws 181 (10th ed.
1773)).

															On that basis, we have repeatedly explained that
matters concerning private rights may not be removed from Article
III courts. Murray’s Lessee, 18 How., at 284;
Granfinanciera, 492 U. S., at 51–52; Stern, 564
U. S., at 484. A hallmark that we have looked to in
determining if a suit concerns private rights is whether it “is
made of ‘the stuff of the traditional actions at common law tried
by the courts at Westminster in 1789.’ ” Id., at 484
(quoting Northern Pipeline Constr. Co. v. Marathon Pipe
Line Co., 458 U.S.
50, 90 (1982) (Rehnquist, J., concurring in judgment)). If a
suit is in the nature of an action at common law, then the matter
presumptively concerns private rights, and adjudication by an
Article III court is mandatory. Stern, 564 U. S., at
484.

															At the same time, our precedent has also
recognized a class of cases concerning what we have called “public
rights.” Such matters “historically could have been determined
exclusively by [the executive and legislative] branches,”
id., at 493 (internal quotation marks omitted), even when
they were “presented in such form that the judicial power [wa]s
capable of acting on them,” Murray’s Lessee, 18 How., at
284. In contrast to common law claims, no involvement by an Article
III court in the initial adjudication is necessary in such a
case.

															The decision that first recognized the public
rights exception was Murray’s Lessee. In that case, a
federal customs collector failed to deliver public funds to the
Treasury, so the Government issued a “warrant of distress” to
compel him to produce the withheld sum. 18 How., at 274–275.
Pursuant to the warrant, the Government eventually seized and sold
a plot of the collector’s land. Id., at 274. Plaintiffs
later attacked the purchaser’s title, arguing that the initial
seizure was void because the Government had audited the collector’s
account and issued the warrant itself without judicial involvement.
Id., at 275.

															The Court upheld the sale. It explained that
pursuant to its power to collect revenue, the Government could rely
on “summary proceedings” to compel its officers to “pay such
balances of the public money” into the Treasury “as may be in their
hands.” Id., at 281, 285. Indeed, the Court observed, there
was an unbroken tradition—long predating the founding—of using
these kinds of proceedings to “enforce payment of balances due from
receivers of the revenue.” Id., at 278; see id., at
281. In light of this historical practice, the Government could
issue a valid warrant without intruding on the domain of the
Judiciary. See id., at 280–282. The challenge to the sale
thus lacked merit.

															This principle extends beyond cases involving
the collection of revenue. In Oceanic Steam Navigation Co.
v. Stranahan, 214 U.S.
320 (1909), we considered the imposition of a monetary penalty
on a steamship company. Pursuant to its plenary power over
immigration, Congress had excluded immigration by aliens afflicted
with “loathsome or dangerous contagious diseases,” and it
authorized customs collectors to enforce the prohibition with
fines. Id., at 331–334. When a steamship company challenged
the penalty under Article III, we upheld it. Congress’s power over
foreign commerce, we explained, was so total that no party had a
“ ‘vested right’ ” to import anything into the country.
Id., at 335 (quoting Buttfield v. Stranahan,
192 U.S.
470, 493 (1904)). By the same token, Congress could also
prohibit immigration by certain classes of persons and enforce
those prohibitions with administrative penalties assessed without a
jury. See Oceanic Steam Navigation Co., 214 U. S., at
339–340.[1]

															In Ex parte Bakelite Corp., we upheld a
law authorizing the President to impose tariffs on goods imported
by “unfair methods of competition.” 279 U.S.
438, 446 (1929). The law permitted him to set whatever tariff
was necessary, subject to a statutory cap, to produce fair
competition. If the President was “satisfied the unfairness [was]
extreme,” the law even authorized him to “exclude[ ]” foreign
goods entirely. Ibid. Because the political branches had
traditionally held exclusive power over this field and had
exercised it, we explained that the assessment of tariffs did not
implicate Article III. Id., at 458, 460–461.

															This Court has since held that certain other
historic categories of adjudications fall within the exception,
including relations with Indian tribes, see United States v.
Jicarilla Apache Nation, 564 U.S.
162, 174 (2011), the administration of public lands,
Crowell v. Benson, 285 U.S.
22, 51 (1932), and the granting of public benefits such as
payments to veterans, ibid., pensions, ibid., and
patent rights, United States v. Duell, 172 U.S.
576, 582–583 (1899).

															Our opinions governing the public rights
exception have not always spoken in precise terms. This is an “area
of frequently arcane distinctions and confusing precedents.”
Thomas v. Union Carbide Agricultural Products Co.,
473 U.S.
568, 583 (1985) (internal quotation marks omitted). The Court
“has not ‘definitively explained’ the distinction between public
and private rights,” and we do not claim to do so today. Oil
States Energy Services, LLC v. Greene’s Energy Group,
LLC, 584 U.S. 325, 334 (2018).

															Nevertheless, since Murray’s Lessee, this
Court has typically evaluated the legal basis for the assertion of
the doctrine with care. The public rights exception is, after all,
an exception. It has no textual basis in the Constitution
and must therefore derive instead from background legal principles.
Murray’s Lessee itself, for example, took pains to justify
the application of the exception in that particular instance by
explaining that it flowed from centuries-old rules concerning
revenue collection by a sovereign. See 18 How., at 281–285. Without
such close attention to the basis for each asserted application of
the doctrine, the exception would swallow the rule.[2]

															From the beginning we have emphasized one point:
“To avoid misconstruction upon so grave a subject, we think it
proper to state that we do not consider congress can
. . . withdraw from judicial cognizance any matter which,
from its nature, is the subject of a suit at the common law, or in
equity, or admiralty.” Murray’s Lessee, 18 How., at 284. We
have never embraced the proposition that “practical” considerations
alone can justify extending the scope of the public rights
exception to such matters. Stern, 564 U. S., at 501.
“[E]ven with respect to matters that arguably fall within the scope
of the ‘public rights’ doctrine, the presumption is in favor of
Article III courts.” Northern Pipeline Constr. Co., 458
U. S., at 69, n. 23 (plurality opinion) (citing
Glidden Co. v. Zdanok, 370 U.S.
530, 548–549, and n. 21 (1962) (plurality opinion)). And
for good reason: “Article III could neither serve its purpose in
the system of checks and balances nor preserve the integrity of
judicial decisionmaking if the other branches of the Federal
Government could confer the Government’s ‘judicial Power’ on
entities outside Article III.” Stern, 564 U. S., at
484.

															2

															This is not the first time we have considered
whether the Seventh Amendment guarantees the right to a jury trial
“in the face of Congress’ decision to allow a non-Article III
tribunal to adjudicate” a statutory “fraud claim.” 492 U. S.,
at 37, 50. We did so in Granfinanciera, and the principles
identified in that case largely resolve this one.

															Granfinanciera involved a statutory
action for fraudulent conveyance. As codified in the Bankruptcy
Code, the claim permitted a trustee to void a transfer or
obligation made by the debtor before bankruptcy if the debtor
“received less than a reasonably equivalent value in exchange for
such transfer or obligation.” 11 U. S. C. §548(a)(2)(A)
(1982 ed., Supp. V). Actions for fraudulent conveyance were well
known at common law. 492 U. S., at 43. Even when Congress
added these claims to the Bankruptcy Code in 1978, see 92Stat.
2600, it preserved parties’ rights to a trial by jury, 492
U. S., at 49–50. In 1984, however, Congress designated
fraudulent conveyance actions “core [bankruptcy] proceedings” and
authorized non-Article III bankruptcy judges to hear them without
juries. Id., at 50.

															The issue in Granfinanciera was whether
this designation was permissible under the public rights exception.
Ibid. We explained that it was not. Although Congress had
assigned fraudulent conveyance claims to bankruptcy courts, that
assignment was not dispositive. See id., at 52. What
mattered, we explained, was the substance of the suit.
“[T]raditional legal claims” must be decided by courts, “whether
they originate in a newly fashioned regulatory scheme or possess a
long line of common-law forebears.” Ibid. To determine
whether the claim implicated the Seventh Amendment, the Court
applied the principles distilled in Tull. We examined
whether the matter was “from [its] nature subject to ‘a suit at
common law.’ ” 492 U. S., at 56 (some internal quotation
marks omitted); see id., at 43–50. A survey of English cases
showed that “actions to recover . . . fraudulent
transfers were often brought at law in late 18th-century England.”
Id., at 43. The remedy the trustee sought was also one
“traditionally provided by law courts.” Id., at 49.
Fraudulent conveyance actions were thus “quintessentially suits at
common law.” Id., at 56.

															We also considered whether these actions were
“closely intertwined” with the bankruptcy regime. Id., at
54. Some bankruptcy claims, such as “creditors’ hierarchically
ordered claims to a pro rata share of the bankruptcy res,”
id., at 56, are highly interdependent and require
coordination. Resolving such claims fairly is only possible if they
are all submitted at once to a single adjudicator. Otherwise,
parties with lower priority claims can rush to the courthouse to
seek payment before higher priority claims exhaust the estate, and
an orderly disposition of a bankruptcy is impossible. Other claims,
though, can be brought in standalone suits, because they are
neither prioritized nor subordinated to related claims. Since
fraudulent conveyance actions fall into that latter category, we
concluded that these actions were not “closely intertwined” with
the bankruptcy process. Id., at 54. We also noted that
Congress had already authorized jury trials for certain bankruptcy
matters, demonstrating that jury trials were not generally
“incompatible” with the overall regime. Id., at 61–62
(internal quotation marks omitted).

															We accordingly concluded that fraudulent
conveyance actions were akin to “suits at common law” and were not
inseparable from the bankruptcy process. Id., at 54, 56. The
public rights exception therefore did not apply, and a jury was
required.

															3

															Granfinanciera effectively decides this
case. Even when an action “originate[s] in a newly fashioned
regulatory scheme,” what matters is the substance of the action,
not where Congress has assigned it. Id., at 52. And in this
case, the substance points in only one direction.

															According to the SEC, these are actions under
the “antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws” for
“fraudulent conduct.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 72a–73a (opinion of
the Commission). They provide civil penalties, a punitive remedy
that we have recognized “could only be enforced in courts of law.”
Tull, 481 U. S., at 422. And they target the same basic
conduct as common law fraud, employ the same terms of art, and
operate pursuant to similar legal principles. See supra, at
10–12. In short, this action involves a “matter[ ] of private
rather than public right.” Granfinanciera, 492 U. S.,
at 56. Therefore, “Congress may not ‘withdraw’ ” it
“ ‘from judicial cognizance.’ ” Stern, 564
U. S., at 484 (quoting Murray’s Lessee, 18 How., at
284).

															4

															Notwithstanding Granfinanciera, the SEC
contends the public rights exception still applies in this case
because Congress created “new statutory obligations, impose[d]
civil penalties for their violation, and then commit[ted] to an
administrative agency the function of deciding whether a violation
ha[d] in fact occurred.” Brief for Petitioner 21 (internal
quotation marks omitted).

															The foregoing from Granfinanciera already
does away with much of the SEC’s argument. Congress cannot “conjure
away the Seventh Amendment by mandating that traditional legal
claims be . . . taken to an administrative tribunal.” 492
U. S., at 52. Nor does the fact that the SEC action
“originate[d] in a newly fashioned regulatory scheme” permit
Congress to siphon this action away from an Article III court.
Ibid. The constructive fraud claim in Granfinanciera
was also statutory, see id., at 37, but we nevertheless
explained that the public rights exception did not apply. Again, if
the action resembles a traditional legal claim, its statutory
origins are not dispositive. See id., at 52, 56.

															The SEC’s sole remaining basis for
distinguishing Granfinanciera is that the Government is the
party prosecuting this action. See Brief for Petitioner 26–28; see
also Tr. of Oral Arg. 25 (Principal Deputy Solicitor General) (the
“critical distinction” in the public rights analysis is
“enforcement by the executive”); id., at 26 (identifying as
“the constitutionally relevant distinction” that “this is something
that has been assigned to a federal agency to enforce”). But we
have never held that “the presence of the United States as a proper
party to the proceeding is . . . sufficient” by itself to
trigger the exception. Northern Pipeline Constr. Co., 458
U. S., at 69, n. 23 (plurality opinion). Again, what matters
is the substance of the suit, not where it is brought, who brings
it, or how it is labeled. See ibid. The object of this SEC
action is to regulate transactions between private individuals
interacting in a pre-existing market. To do so, the Government has
created claims whose causes of action are modeled on common law
fraud and that provide a type of remedy available only in law
courts. This is a common law suit in all but name. And such suits
typically must be adjudicated in Article III courts.

															5

															The principal case on which the SEC and the
dissent rely is Atlas Roofing Co. v. Occupational Safety
and Health Review Commission, 430 U.S.
442 (1977). Because the public rights exception as construed in
Atlas Roofing does not extend to these civil penalty suits
for fraud, that case does not control. And for that same reason, we
need not reach the suggestion made by Jarkesy and Patriot28 that
Tull and Granfinanciera effectively overruled
Atlas Roofing to the extent that case construed the public
rights exception to allow the adjudication of civil penalty suits
in administrative tribunals.[3]

															The litigation in Atlas Roofing arose
under the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 (OSH Act), a
federal regulatory regime created to promote safe working
conditions. Id., at 444–445. The Act authorized the
Secretary of Labor to promulgate safety regulations, and it
empowered the Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission
(OSHRC) to adjudicate alleged violations. Id., at 445–446.
If a party violated the regulations, the agency could impose civil
penalties. Id., at 446.

															Unlike the claims in Granfinanciera and
this action, the OSH Act did not borrow its cause of action from
the common law. Rather, it simply commanded that “[e]ach employer
. . . shall comply with occupational safety and health
standards promulgated under this chapter.” 84Stat. 1593, 29
U. S. C. §654(a)(2) (1976 ed.). These standards bring no
common law soil with them. Cf. Hansen, 599 U. S., at
778. Rather than reiterate common law terms of art, they instead
resembled a detailed building code. For example, the OSH Act
regulations directed that a ground trench wall of “Solid Rock,
Shale, or Cemented Sand and Gravels” could be constructed at a 90
degree angle to the ground. 29 CFR §1926.652, Table P–1 (1976); see
Atlas Roofing, 430 U. S., at 447 (discussing Table
P–1). But a wall of “Compacted Angular Gravels” needed to be sloped
at 63 degrees, and a wall of “Well Rounded Loose Sand” at 26
degrees. §1926.652, Table P–1. The purpose of this regime was not
to enable the Federal Government to bring or adjudicate claims that
traced their ancestry to the common law. Rather, Congress stated
that it intended the agency to “develop[ ] innovative methods,
techniques, and approaches for dealing with occupational safety and
health problems.” 29 U. S. C. §651(b)(5) (1976 ed.). In
both concept and execution, the Act was self-consciously novel.

															Facing enforcement actions, two employers
alleged that the adjudicatory authority of the OSHRC violated the
Seventh Amendment. See Atlas Roofing, 430 U. S., at
448–449. The Court rejected the challenge, concluding that “when
Congress creates new statutory ‘public rights,’ it may assign their
adjudication to an administrative agency with which a jury trial
would be incompatible, without violating the Seventh
Amendment[ ].” Id., at 455. As the Court explained, the
case involved “a new cause of action, and remedies therefor,
unknown to the common law.” Id., at 461. The Seventh
Amendment, the Court concluded, was accordingly “no bar to
. . . enforcement outside the regular courts of law.”
Ibid.

															The cases that Atlas Roofing relied upon
did not extend the public rights exception to “traditional legal
claims.” Granfinanciera, 492 U. S., at 52. Instead,
they applied the exception to actions that were “ ‘not
. . . suit[s] at common law or in the nature of such
. . . suit[s].’ ” Atlas Roofing, 430
U. S., at 453 (quoting Jones & Laughlin Steel
Corp., 301 U. S., at 48); see Atlas Roofing, 430
U. S., at 450–451 (discussing, e.g., Murray’s
Lessee, Ex parte Bakelite Corp., Helvering
v. Mitchell, 303 U.S.
391 (1938), and Oceanic Steam Navigation Co.). Indeed,
the Court recognized that if a case did involve a common law action
or its equivalent, a jury was required. See 430 U. S., at 455
(“ ‘[W]here the action involves rights and remedies recognized
at common law, it must preserve to parties their right to a jury
trial.’ ” (quoting Pernell v. Southall Realty,
416 U.S.
363, 383 (1974)); Atlas Roofing, 430 U. S., at
458–459 (jury required when “courts of law supplied a cause of
action and an adequate remedy to the litigant”).

															Atlas Roofing concluded that Congress
could assign the OSH Act adjudications to an agency because the
claims were “unknown to the common law.” 430 U. S., at 461.
The case therefore does not control here, where the statutory claim
is “ ‘in the nature of ’ ” a common law suit.
Id., at 453 (quoting Jones & Laughlin, 301
U. S., at 48). As we have explained, Jarkesy and Patriot28
were prosecuted for “fraudulent conduct,” App. to Pet. for Cert.
72a, and the pertinent statutory provisions derive from, and are
interpreted in light of, their common law counterparts, see 15
U. S. C. §§77q(a)(2), 78j(b), 80b–6(4); 17 CFR
§§240.10b–5(b), 275.206(4)–8(a)(1); Basic Inc., 485
U. S., at 253 (opinion of White, J.).

															The reasoning of Atlas Roofing cannot
support any broader rule. The dissent chants “Atlas Roofing”
like a mantra, but no matter how many times it repeats those words,
it cannot give Atlas Roofing substance that it
lacks.[4] Even as Atlas
Roofing invoked the public rights exception, the definition it
offered of the exception was circular. The exception applied, the
Court said, “in cases in which ‘public rights’ are being
litigated—e. g., cases in which the Government sues in
its sovereign capacity to enforce public rights created by
statutes.” 430 U. S., at 450; see id., at 458.

															After Atlas Roofing, this Court clarified
in Tull that the Seventh Amendment does apply to novel
statutory regimes, so long as the claims are akin to common law
claims. See 481 U. S., at 421–423. In addition, we have
explained that the public rights exception does not apply
automatically whenever Congress assigns a matter to an agency for
adjudication. See Granfinanciera, 492 U. S., at 52.

															For its part, the dissent also seems to suggest
that Atlas Roofing establishes that the public rights
exception applies whenever a statute increases governmental
efficiency. Post, at 15 (opinion of Sotomayor, J.). Again,
our precedents foreclose this argument. As Stern explained,
effects like increasing efficiency and reducing public costs are
not enough to trigger the exception. See 564 U. S., at 501;
INS v. Chadha, 462 U.S.
919, 944 (1983). Otherwise, evading the Seventh Amendment would
become nothing more than a game, where the Government need only
identify some slight advantage to the public from agency
adjudication to strip its target of the protections of the Seventh
Amendment.

															The novel claims in Atlas Roofing had
never been brought in an Article III court. By contrast, law courts
have dealt with fraud actions since before the founding, and
Congress had authorized the SEC to bring such actions in Article
III courts and still authorizes the SEC to do so today. See 3
Blackstone 41–42; §§77t, 78u, 80b–9. Given the judiciary’s long
history of handling fraud claims, it cannot be argued that the
courts lack the capacity needed to adjudicate such actions.

															In short, Atlas Roofing does not conflict
with our conclusion. When a matter “from its nature, is the subject
of a suit at the common law,” Congress may not “withdraw [it] from
judicial cognizance.” Murray’s Lessee, 18 How., at 284.

															*  *  *

															A defendant facing a fraud suit has the right
to be tried by a jury of his peers before a neutral adjudicator.
Rather than recognize that right, the dissent would permit Congress
to concentrate the roles of prosecutor, judge, and jury in the
hands of the Executive Branch. That is the very opposite of the
separation of powers that the Constitution demands. Jarkesy and
Patriot28 are entitled to a jury trial in an Article III court. We
do not reach the remaining constitutional issues and affirm the
ruling of the Fifth Circuit on the Seventh Amendment ground
alone.

															The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the
Fifth Circuit is affirmed, and the case is remanded for further
proceedings consistent with this opinion.

															It is so ordered.

Notes
1
 The dissent asserts that
Oceanic Steam Navigation stands for the proposition that the
public rights exception applies to any exercise of power granted to
Congress. Post, at 10–11 (opinion of Sotomayor, J). It must
be reading from a different case than we are. Oceanic Steam
Navigation expressly confines its analysis to the exercise of
Congress’s power over foreign commerce. 214 U. S., at
339 (“It is insisted that the decisions just stated and the
legislative practices referred to are inapposite here, because they
all relate to subjects peculiarly within the authority of the
legislative department of the Government, and which, from the
necessity of things, required the concession that administrative
officers should have the authority to enforce designated penalties
without resort to the courts. But over no conceivable subject is
the legislative power of Congress more complete than it is over
that with which the act we are now considering deals.); id.,
at 334 (explaining that the statute “rest[s] . . . upon
the authority of Congress over foreign commerce and its
right to control the coming of aliens into the United States”
(emphasis added)); id., at 340 (citing “the authority of
Congress over the right to bring aliens into the United States”);
see id., at 339 (discussing congressional power over “the
valuation of imported merchandise,” “ ‘importers,’ ” and
“tariff[s]” (quoting Bartlett v. Kane, 16 How. 263,
274 (1854)); 214 U. S., at 334 (expressly acknowledging and
avoiding comment on “ ‘limitations’ ” of Congress’s
“ ‘interstate commerce’ ” power because this case
concerns instead Congress’s exercise of its “ ‘plenary power
in respect to the exclusion of merchandise brought from
foreign countries’ ” (quoting Buttfield v.
Stranahan, 192 U.S.
470, 492 (1904); emphasis added). Nowhere does Oceanic Steam
Navigation say that the public rights exception applies to
cases concerning the securities markets or interstate commerce more
broadly. The rules the dissent purports to locate in Oceanic
Steam Navigation are therefore wholly inapposite.
2
 The dissent would brush
away these careful distinctions and unfurl a new rule: that
whenever Congress passes a statute “entitl[ing] the Government to
civil penalties,” the defendant’s right to a jury and a neutral
Article III adjudicator disappears. See post, at 2 (opinion
of Sotomayor, J.). It bases this rule not in the constitutional
text (where it would find no foothold), nor in the ratification
history (where again it would find no support), nor in a careful,
category-by-category analysis of underlying legal principles of the
sort performed by Murray’s Lessee (which it does not
attempt), nor even in a case-specific functional analysis (also not
attempted). Instead, the dissent extrapolates from the outcomes in
cases concerning unrelated applications of the public rights
exception and from one opinion, Atlas Roofing Co. v.
Occupational Safety and Health Review Comm’n, 430 U.S.
442 (1977). The result is to blur the distinctions our cases
have drawn in favor of the legally unsound principle that just
because the Government may extract civil penalties in
administrative tribunals in some contexts, it must always be able
to do so in all contexts. The dissent also appeals to practice,
ignoring that the statute Jarkesy and Patriot28 have been
prosecuted under is barely over a decade old. It is also unclear
how practice could transmute a private right into a public one, or
how the absence of legal challenges brought by one generation could
waive the individual rights of the next. Practice may be probative
when it reflects the settled institutional understandings of the
branches. That case is far weaker when the rights of individuals
are directly at stake.
3
 The dissent chides us for
“leav[ing] open the possibility that Granfinanciera might
have overruled Atlas Roofing.” Post, at 25, n. 8
(opinion of Sotomayor, J.). But the author of Atlas Roofing
certainly thought that Granfinanciera may have done so. See
Granfinanciera, 492 U. S., at 79 (White, J.,
dissenting) (“Perhaps . . . Atlas Roofing is no
longer good law after today’s decision.”); see also id., at
71, n. 1 (Granfinanciera “can be read as overruling or
severely limiting” Atlas Roofing).
4
 Reading the dissent, one
might also think that Atlas Roofing is among this Court’s
most celebrated cases. As the concurrence shows, Atlas
Roofing represents a departure from our legal traditions. See
post, at 12–20 (opinion of Gorsuch, J.). This view is also
reflected in the scholarship. Commentators writing comprehensively
on Article III and agency adjudication have often simply ignored
the case. See, e.g., R. Fallon, Of Legislative Courts,
Administrative Agencies, and Article III, 101 Harv. L. Rev. 915
(1988) (no citation to Atlas Roofing); J. Harrison, Public
Rights, Private Privileges, and Article III, 54 Ga. L. Rev. 143
(2019) (same); W. Baude, Adjudication Outside Article III, 133
Harv. L. Rev. 1511 (2020) (same). Others who have considered
it have offered nothing but a variety of criticisms. See,
e.g., R. Kirst, Administrative Penalties and the
Civil Jury: The Supreme Court’s Assault on the Seventh Amendment,
126 U. Pa. L. Rev. 1281, 1294 (1978) (through its “careless use of
precedent,” Atlas Roofing did “not recognize or
[mis]understood” “careful distinctions developed by . . .
earlier judges”); G. Young, Federal Courts & Federal Rights, 45
Brooklyn L. Rev. 1145, 1153 (1979) (“The Atlas Court
. . . failed to offer an adequate justification for its
interpretation of the seventh amendment, either in terms of
precedent or the language and history of the amendment.”); M.
Redish & D. La Fave, Seventh Amendment Right to Jury Trial in
Non-Article III Proceedings: A Study in Dysfunctional
Constitutional Theory, 4 Wm. & Mary Bill of Right J. 407, 436
(1995) (criticizing Atlas Roofing for failing to “provid[e]
a principled basis upon which to determine the proper scope of
congressional power to remove the civil jury from federal
adjudications”); V. Amar, Implementing an Historical Version of the
Jury in an Age of Administrative Factfinding and Sentencing
Guidelines, 47 S. Tex. L. Rev. 291, 298 (2005) (questioning
Atlas Roofing for “invert[ing] and turn[ing] on its head the
Apprendi doctrine’s central insight that juries are most
important to check the power of the state” (emphasis deleted)); C.
Nelson, Adjudication in the Political Branches, 107 Colum. L. Rev.
559, 604–605, and n. 189 (2007) (describing Atlas Roofing as
“misus[ing]” precedent to “deny the novelty of its holding” and
“drive a wedge” into the traditional understanding of the
public-private rights distinction). We express no opinion on these
various criticisms.
