															MACQUARIE INFRASTRUCTURE CORPORATION,
et al., PETITIONERS v. MOAB PARTNERS, L. P.,
et al.

															on writ of certiorari to the united states
court of appeals for the second circuit

															[April 12, 2024]

															Justice Sotomayor delivered the opinion of the
Court.

															Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Rule
10b–5(b) makes it unlawful to omit material facts in connection
with buying or selling securities when that omission renders
“statements made” misleading. Separately, Item 303 of SEC
Regulation S–K requires companies to disclose certain information
in periodic filings with the SEC. The question in this case is
whether the failure to disclose information required by Item 303
can support a private action under Rule 10b–5(b), even if the
failure does not render any “statements made” misleading. The Court
holds that it cannot. Pure omissions are not actionable under Rule
10b–5(b).

															I

															A

															Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934 makes it “unlawful for any person . . . [t]o use
or employ, in connection with the purchase or sale of any security
. . . [,] any manipulative or deceptive device or
contrivance in contravention of such rules and regulations as the
[SEC] may prescribe.” 48Stat. 891, 15 U. S. C. §78j(b).
Rule 10b–5 implements this prohibition and makes it unlawful for
issuers of registered securities to “make any untrue statement of a
material fact or to omit to state a material fact necessary in
order to make the statements made, in the light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.” 17 CFR
§240.10b–5(b) (2022). This Court “has found a right of action
implied in the words of [§10(b)] and its implementing regulation.”
Stoneridge Investment Partners, LLC v.
Scientific-Atlanta, Inc., 552 U.S.
148, 157 (2008).

															Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act requires
issuers to file periodic informational statements. See 15
U. S. C. §§78m(a)(1), 78l(b)(1). These statements
include the “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Conditions and Results of Operation” (MD&A), in which companies
must “[f]urnish the information required by Item 303 of Regulation
S–K.” See SEC Form 10–K; SEC Form 10–Q. Item 303, in turn, requires
companies to “[d]escribe any known trends or uncertainties that
have had or that are reasonably likely to have a material favorable
or unfavorable impact on net sales or revenues or income from
continuing operations.” 17 CFR §229.303(b)(2)(ii) (2022).

															B

															Macquarie Infrastructure Corporation owns
infrastructure-related businesses, including a subsidiary that
operates large “bulk liquid storage terminals” within the United
States. These terminals handle and store liquid commodities, such
as petroleum, biofuels, chemicals, and oil products. One liquid
commodity stored in these terminals is No. 6 fuel oil, a
high-sulfur fuel oil that is a byproduct of the refining process.
In 2016, the United Nations’ International Maritime Organization
formally adopted IMO 2020, a regulation that capped the sulfur
content of fuel oil used in shipping at 0.5% by the beginning of
2020. No. 6 fuel oil typically has a sulfur content closer to 3%.
In the ensuing years, Macquarie did not discuss IMO 2020 in its
public offering documents. In February 2018, however, Macquarie
announced that the amount of storage capacity contracted for use by
its subsidiary’s customers had dropped in part because of the
structural decline in the No. 6 fuel oil market. Macquarie’s stock
price fell around 41%.

															Moab Partners, L. P. sued Macquarie and various
officer defendants, alleging, among other things, a violation of
§10(b) and Rule 10b–5. The crux of Moab’s argument was that
Macquarie’s public statements “were false and misleading” because
it “concealed from investors that [its subsidiary’s] single largest
product . . . was No. 6 fuel oil,” which “faced a
near-cataclysmic ban on the bulk of its worldwide use through IMO
2020.” City of Riviera Beach Gen. Employees Retirement
System v. Macquarie Infrastructure Corp., 2021 WL
4084572, *6 (SDNY, Sept. 7, 2021) (internal quotation marks
omitted). In Moab’s view, Macquarie had “ ‘a duty to disclose’
the extent to which [its subsidiary’s] storage capacity was devoted
to No. 6 fuel oil,” ibid., but instead, Macquarie “violated
disclosure obligations under Item 303,” id., at *10, and
therefore violated §10(b) and Rule 10b–5. The District Court
dismissed Moab’s complaint, concluding in relevant part that Moab
had not “actually plead[ed] an uncertainty that should have been
disclosed” or “in what SEC filing or filings Defendants were
supposed to disclose it.” Ibid.

															The Second Circuit reversed. The court reasoned
that there are “two circumstances which impose a duty on a
corporation to disclose omitted facts.” 2022 WL 17815767, *1 (Dec.
20, 2022). First, a duty arises when there is “ ‘a statute or
regulation requiring disclosure,’ . . . such as Ite[m]
303.” Ibid. (quoting Stratte-McClure v. Morgan
Stanley, 776 F.3d 94, 101 (CA2 2015)). Second, “[e]ven when
there is no existing independent duty to disclose information, once
a company speaks on an issue or topic, there is a duty to tell the
whole truth.” 2022 WL 17815767, *1 (internal quotation marks
omitted). “Crediting [Moab’s] allegations as true, IMO 2020’s
significant restriction of No. 6 fuel oil use was known to
[Macquarie] and reasonably likely to have material effects on
[Macquarie’Id., at *3. Because Moab had “adequately alleged
a ‘known trend[ ] or uncertaint[y]’ that gave rise to a duty
to disclose under Item 303,” id., at *2 (alterations in
original), the court applied its binding precedent to conclude that
Macquarie’s Item 303 violation alone could sustain Moab’s §10(b)
and Rule 10b–5 claim. See ibid. (“The failure to make a
material disclosure required by Item 303 can serve as the basis
. . . for a claim under Section 10(b)”).

															The courts of appeals disagree on whether a
failure to make a disclosure required by Item 303 can support a
private claim under §10(b) and Rule 10b–5(b) in the absence of an
otherwise-misleading statement.[1] This Court granted certiorari to resolve that
disagreement. 600 U. S. ___ (2023).

															II

															Rule 10b–5(b) makes it unlawful “[t]o make any
untrue statement of a material fact or to omit to state a material
fact necessary in order to make the statements made, in the light
of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.”
17 CFR §240.10b–5(b). This Rule accomplishes two things. It
prohibits “any untrue statement of a material
fact”—i.e., false statements or lies. Ibid. It
also prohibits omitting a material fact necessary “to make the
statements made . . . not misleading.” Ibid. This
case turns on whether this second prohibition bars only half-truths
or instead extends to pure omissions.

															A pure omission occurs when a speaker says
nothing, in circumstances that do not give any particular meaning
to that silence. Take the simplest example. If a company fails
entirely to file an MD&A, then the omission of particular
information required in the MD&A has no special significance
because no information was disclosed. Half-truths, on the other
hand, are “representations that state the truth only so far as it
goes, while omitting critical qualifying information.” Universal
Health Services, Inc. v. United States ex rel.
Escobar, 579 U.S. 176, 188 (2016); see also Omnicare,
Inc. v. Laborers Dist. Council Constr. Industry Pension
Fund, 575 U.S.
175, 192 (2015) (“[L]iteral accuracy is not enough: An issuer
must as well desist from misleading investors by saying one thing
and holding back another”). “A classic example of an actionable
half-truth in contract law is the seller who reveals that there may
be two new roads near a property he is selling, but fails to
disclose that a third potential road might bisect the property.”
Universal Health Services, 579 U. S., at 188–189. In
other words, the difference between a pure omission and a
half-truth is the difference between a child not telling his
parents he ate a whole cake and telling them he had dessert.

															Rule 10b–5(b) does not proscribe pure omissions.
The Rule prohibits omitting material facts necessary to make the
“statements made . . . not misleading.” Put differently,
it requires disclosure of information necessary to ensure that
statements already made are clear and complete (i.e.,
that the dessert was, in fact, a whole cake). This Rule therefore
covers half-truths, not pure omissions. Logically and by its plain
text, the Rule requires identifying affirmative assertions
(i.e., “statements made”) before determining if other
facts are needed to make those statements “not misleading.” See,
e.g., 6 Oxford English Dictionary 857 (1933) (def. 3)
(defining “statement” as a “written or oral communication setting
forth facts, arguments, demands, or the like”); Webster’s New
International Dictionary 2461 (2d ed. 1942) (defining “statement”
as the “[a]ct of stating, reciting, or presenting, orally or on
paper”). It once again “bears emphasis that §10(b) and Rule
10b–5(b) do not create an affirmative duty to disclose any and all
material information. Disclosure is required under these provisions
only when necessary ‘to make . . . statements made, in
the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading.’ ” Matrixx Initiatives, Inc. v.
Siracusano, 563 U.S.
27, 44 (2011) (quoting Rule 10b–5(b)).

															Statutory context confirms what the text plainly
provides. Congress imposed liability for pure omissions in §11(a)
of the Securities Act of 1933. Section 11(a) prohibits any
registration statement that “contain[s] an untrue statement of a
material fact or omit[s] to state a material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not
misleading.” 15 U. S. C. §77k(a). By its terms, in
addition to proscribing lies and half-truths, this section also
creates liability for failure to speak on a subject at all. See
Omnicare, 575 U. S., at 186, n. 3 (“Section 11’s
omissions clause also applies when an issuer fails to make mandated
disclosures—those ‘required to be stated’—in a registration
statement”). There is no similar language in §10(b) or Rule
10b–5(b). Cf. Ernst & Ernst v. Hochfelder,
425 U.S.
185, 208 (1976) (“The express recognition of a cause of action
premised on negligent behavior in §11 stands in sharp contrast to
the language of §10(b)”). Neither Congress in §10(b) nor the SEC in
Rule 10b–5(b) mirrored §11(a) to create liability for pure
omissions. That omission (unlike a pure omission) is telling. Cf.
Blue Chip Stamps v. Manor Drug Stores, 421 U.S.
723, 734 (1975) (“When Congress wished to provide a remedy
. . . it had little trouble in doing so expressly”).

															“Silence, absent a duty to disclose, is not
misleading under Rule 10b–5.” Basic Inc. v. Levinson,
485 U.S.
224, 239, n. 17 (1988). Even a duty to disclose, however, does
not automatically render silence misleading under Rule 10b–5(b).
Today, this Court confirms that the failure to disclose information
required by Item 303 can support a Rule 10b–5(b) claim only if the
omission renders affirmative statements made misleading.

															Moab and the United States suggest that a
plaintiff does not need to plead any statements rendered misleading
by a pure omission because reasonable investors know that Item 303
requires an MD&A to disclose all known trends and
uncertainties. That argument fails, however, because it reads the
words “statements made” out of Rule 10b–5(b) and shifts the focus
of that Rule and §10(b) from fraud to disclosure. See
Chiarella v. United States, 445
U.S. 222, 234–235 (1980) (“Section 10(b) is aptly described as
a catchall provision, but what it catches must be fraud”). It would
also render §11(a)’s pure omission clause superfluous by making
every omission of a fact “required to be stated” a misleading
half-truth.

															Moab also contends that without private
liability for pure omissions under Rule 10b–5(b), there will be
“broad immunity any time an issuer fraudulently omits information
Congress and the SEC require it to disclose.” Brief for Respondent
Moab Partners, L. P. 1. That is not so. For one thing, private
parties remain free to bring claims based on Item 303 violations
that create misleading half-truths. For another, the SEC retains
authority to prosecute violations of its own regulations. The
Exchange Act requires that issuers file reports “in accordance with
such rules and regulations as the Commission may prescribe,” 15
U. S. C. §78m(a), and the SEC can investigate “whether
any person has violated . . . any provision of [the
Exchange Act], [or] the rules and regulations thereunder,”
§78u(a)(1), including Item 303.[2]

															*  *  *

															Pure omissions are not actionable under Rule
10b–5(b). The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Second
Circuit is vacated, and the case is remanded for further
proceedings consistent with this opinion.

															It is so ordered.

Notes

 Compare
Stratte-McClure v. Morgan Stanley, 776 F.3d 94, 101
(CA2 2015) (“Item 303’s affirmative duty to disclose in Form 10–Qs
can serve as the basis for a securities fraud claim under Section
10(b)”), with In re Nvidia, 768 F.3d 1046, 1056 (CA9 2014)
(“Item 303 does not create a duty to disclose for purposes of
Section 10(b) and Rule 10b–5”); see also Oran v.
Stafford, 
226 F.3d 275, 288 (CA3 2000) (“[T]he ‘demonstration of a
violation of the disclosure requirements of Item 303 does not lead
inevitably to the conclusion that such disclosure would be required
under Rule 10b–5. Such a duty to disclose must be separately
shown’ ”).

 Moab and the United
States spill much ink fighting the question presented, insisting
that this case is about half-truths rather than pure omissions. The
Court granted certiorari to address the Second Circuit’s pure
omission analysis, not its half-truth analysis. See Pet. for Cert.
i (“Whether . . . a failure to make a disclosure required under
Item 303 can support a private claim under Section 10(b), even
in the absence of an otherwise-misleading statement” (emphasis
added)); see also 2022 WL 17815767, *1 (Dec. 20, 2022)
(distinguishing between these “two circumstances”). The Court does
not opine on issues that are either tangential to the question
presented or were not passed upon below, including what constitutes
“statements made,” when a statement is misleading as a half-truth,
or whether Rules 10b–5(a) and 10b–5(c) support liability for pure
omissions.
