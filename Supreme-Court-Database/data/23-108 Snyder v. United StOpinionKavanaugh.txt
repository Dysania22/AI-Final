															JAMES E. SNYDER, PETITIONER v. UNITED
STATES

															on writ of certiorari to the united states
court of appeals for the seventh circuit

															[June 26, 2024]

															

															Justice Kavanaugh delivered the opinion of the
Court.

															Section 666 of Title 18 makes it a crime for
state and local officials to “corruptly” solicit, accept, or agree
to accept “anything of value from any person, intending to be
influenced or rewarded” for an official act. §666(a)(1)(B). That
law prohibits state and local officials from accepting
bribes that are promised or given before the official act.
Those bribes are punishable by up to 10 years’ imprisonment.

															The question in this case is whether §666 also
makes it a crime for state and local officials to accept
gratuities—for example, gift cards, lunches, plaques, books,
framed photos, or the like—that may be given as a token of
appreciation after the official act. The answer is no. State and
local governments often regulate the gifts that state and local
officials may accept. Section 666 does not supplement those state
and local rules by subjecting 19 million state and local officials
to up to 10 years in federal prison for accepting even commonplace
gratuities. Rather, §666 leaves it to state and local governments
to regulate gratuities to state and local officials.

															I

															A

															Federal and state law distinguish between two
kinds of payments to public officials—bribes and gratuities. As a
general matter, bribes are payments made or agreed to before
an official act in order to influence the official with respect to
that future official act. American law generally treats bribes as
inherently corrupt and unlawful.

															But the law’s treatment of gratuities is more
nuanced. Gratuities are typically payments made to an official
after an official act as a token of appreciation. Some
gratuities can be problematic. Others are commonplace and might be
innocuous. A family gives a holiday tip to the mail carrier.
Parents send an end-of-year gift basket to their child’s public
school teacher. A college dean gives a college sweatshirt to a city
council member who comes to speak at an event. A state legislator’s
neighbor drops off a bottle of wine to congratulate her for her
work on a new law.

															As those examples suggest, gratuities after the
official act are not the same as bribes before the official act.
After all, unlike gratuities, bribes can corrupt the official
act—meaning that the official takes the act for private gain, not
for the public good. That said, gratuities can sometimes also raise
ethical and appearance concerns. For that reason, Congress, States,
and local governments have long regulated gratuities to public
officials.

															Not surprisingly, different governments draw
lines in different places. For example, some States allow public
officials to accept gifts below certain threshold amounts.
E.g., Colo. Const., Art. XXIX, §3(6) (allowing gifts
under $75); Kan. Stat. Ann. §46–237(a)(1) (2021) (allowing gifts
under $40 per year); Mass. Gen. Laws, ch. 268A, §§3(b), (f), 23(b),
(f) (2020) (allowing gifts under $50); W. Va. Code Ann. §61–5A–6(b)
(Lexis 2020) (allowing “trivial” gifts that pose “no substantial
risk of affecting official impartiality”).

															Some States bar accepting any gifts for specific
activities, like certain speaking engagements. E.g.,
Ark. Code Ann. §5–52–108 (2016). Some States make accepting gifts
for official conduct a misdemeanor. E.g., Del. Code
Ann., Tit. 11, §1206 (Cum. Supp. 2022); W. Va. Code Ann.
§61–5A–9(d). Other States make it a felony. E.g.,
Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §§38–505(A), 38–510(A)(1) (2019).

															Many States make exceptions for certain gifts,
such as gifts from friends or family, travel reimbursements,
campaign contributions, and ceremonial gifts like honorary degrees
and plaques. E.g., Colo. Const., Art. XXIX, §3(3);
Mass. Gen. Laws, ch. 268A, §§3(f), 23(f); N. Y. Legis. Law
Ann. §1–c(j) (West Cum. Supp. 2024); W. Va. Code Ann.
§61–5A–6(b).

															Like the States, the counties, cities, and towns
of America take various approaches to regulating gratuities to
their officials. Just within the State of Indiana, where the
current case arose, some local governments set a gift limit of $50,
or $100, or $200, or $300. E.g., Butler, Ind., Code
of Ordinances §30.27(G) (2019); Gary, Ind., Municipal Code
§2–472(b)(1) (2021); Valparaiso, Ind., Code of Ordinances
§36.05(B)(6) (2024); Noblesville, Ind., Code of Ordinances
§36.05(B)(2) (2024).

															Some prohibit gifts only from business entities
currently doing business with the local government.
E.g., Carmel, Ind., Code of Ordinances §2–184(f)(3)
(2024). Others restrict gifts from businesses bidding for
government contracts. E.g., Johnson County, Ind.,
Code of Ordinances §4–6–1–1 (2024).

															With respect to gratuities to state and local
officials, many of those officials are part-time and are allowed to
hold outside employment. That reality can create complications for
regulating gifts to those officials, and the rules often reflect
that reality.

															Meanwhile, Congress has established federal
standards for federal officials. In 1962, Congress passed and
President Kennedy signed into law 18 U. S. C. §201, which
contains comprehensive prohibitions on bribes and gratuities to
federal officials. See 76Stat. 1119. As to gratuities, that statute
imposes criminal penalties on federal officials who seek or accept
“anything of value” for “any official act.” 18 U. S. C.
§201(c)(1)(B).

															The U. S. Office of Government Ethics, or
OGE, has implemented §201 and promulgated numerous gratuities rules
and exceptions. See 5 CFR §2635.202(c) (2023). For example, OGE has
stated that federal officials may accept gifts that are “motivated
by a family relationship or personal friendship,” not by the
“position of the employee.” §2635.204(b). And OGE has also carved
out exceptions for officials to accept gifts of $20 or less per
occasion, awards and honorary degrees, refreshments at social
events, and the like. See §2635.204.

															Importantly, because bribery can corrupt the
official act, Congress treats bribery as a far more serious offense
than gratuities. For example, if a federal official accepts a
bribe, federal bribery law provides for a 15-year maximum prison
sentence. See 18 U. S. C. §201(b). By contrast, if a
federal official accepts a prohibited gratuity, federal gratuities
law sets a 2-year maximum prison sentence. See §201(c).

															B

															In the 1970s and early 1980s, confusion emerged
in the Courts of Appeals over whether the federal bribery and
gratuities laws in §201(b) and §201(c) applied not only to federal
officials but also to state and local officials. See Salinas
v. United States, 522 U.S.
52, 58 (1997). In response, Congress passed and President
Reagan signed a law now codified at 18 U. S. C. §666. See
98Stat. 2143.

															As relevant here, §666 originally extended the
gratuities prohibition in §201(c) to most state and local
officials. See Salinas, 522 U. S., at 58; 18 U. S. C.
§666(b) (1982 ed., Supp. II).

															But after only two years, Congress reversed
course. In 1986, Congress amended §666 and thereby avoided the
law’s “possible application to acceptable commercial and business
practices.” H. R. Rep. No. 99–797, p. 30 (1986); see 100Stat.
3612–3613. As a result of its amendment in 1986, the text of §666
for state and local officials now closely resembles the bribery
provision for federal officials, §201(b), rather than the
gratuities provision for federal officials, §201(c). As relevant
here, §666 makes it a crime for most state and local officials to
“corruptly” solicit, accept, or agree to accept “anything of value”
“intending to be influenced or rewarded in connection with” any
official business or transaction worth $5,000 or more.
§§666(a)(1)(B), (b). That crime carries a 10-year maximum prison
sentence. §666(a).

															C

															This case involves the former mayor of Portage,
Indiana. Portage is a city in northwest Indiana with a population
of about 38,000.

															Like other States, Indiana criminalizes bribery
committed by state and local officials. See Ind. Code
§35–44.1–1–2(a)(2) (2023). Indiana also prescribes civil penalties
such as fines, reprimands, and disqualification from state
employment if state officials accept gratuities in violation of the
State’s Code of Ethics. See Ind. Code §4–2–6–12 (2021); 42 Ind.
Admin. Code §1–5–1 (2024).

															But Indiana does not impose general criminal or
civil prohibitions on local officials who accept gratuities,
leaving such regulation to the local governments themselves. As
relevant here, the City of Portage sets limits on the gifts that
local officials can accept from contractors doing business with the
City. See Portage, Ind., Municipal Code of Ordinances
§§2–178(e)–(f) (2024).

															In 2013, the City of Portage awarded two
contracts to a local truck company, Great Lakes Peterbilt, to
purchase trash trucks. In total, the City paid about $1.1 million
for five trucks.

															In 2014, Peterbilt cut a $13,000 check to James
Snyder, who was the mayor of Portage (and had been at the time of
the contracts). The FBI and federal prosecutors suspected that the
payment was a gratuity for the City’s trash truck contracts. But
Snyder said that he had also agreed to be a contractor for
Peterbilt, providing consulting services. (Like many jurisdictions
around the country, neither Indiana nor Portage apparently
prohibited local officials from obtaining outside employment.)
Snyder said that the payment was for his consulting services.

															Snyder has never been charged by state
prosecutors for bribery. And he has never been charged or
disciplined by Portage for violating the City’s gift rules. The
Federal Government charged and a federal jury convicted Snyder of
accepting an illegal gratuity (the $13,000 check from Peterbilt) in
violation of 18 U. S. C. §666(a)(1)(B). The Government
asked for about a 4- to 5-year prison sentence. The District Court
sentenced Snyder to 1 year and 9 months in prison. App. to Pet. for
Cert. 47a.

															On appeal, Snyder argued that §666 criminalizes
only bribes, not gratuities. The U. S. Court of Appeals for
the Seventh Circuit disagreed based on that court’s precedent
interpreting §666 to cover both bribes and gratuities. 71
F. 4th 555, 578–580 (2023). So the Court of Appeals affirmed
the conviction.

															In light of a split in the Courts of Appeals
over whether §666 criminalizes gratuities as well as bribes, this
Court granted certiorari. 601 U. S. ___ (2023). Compare
United States v. Hamilton, 46 F. 4th 389, 397
(CA5 2022); United States v. Fernandez, 722 F.3d 1,
26 (CA1 2013), with United States v. Abbey, 560 F.3d
513, 520 (CA6 2009); United States v. Zimmermann, 509
F.3d 920, 927 (CA8 2007); United States v. Agostino,

132 F.3d 1183, 1190 (CA7 1997); United States v.
Bonito, 
57 F.3d 167, 171 (CA2 1995).

															II

															A

															The question in this case is whether 18
U. S. C. §666(a)(1)(B) makes it a federal crime for state
and local officials to accept gratuities for their past official
acts. The answer is no. Six reasons, taken together, lead us to
conclude that §666 is a bribery statute and not a gratuities
statute—text, statutory history, statutory structure, statutory
punishments, federalism, and fair notice.

															First is the text of §666. Section
666(a)(1)(B) makes it a crime for state and local officials to
“corruptly” accept a payment “intending to be influenced or
rewarded” for an official act.[1] Congress modeled the text of §666(a)(1)(B) for state
and local officials on §201(b), the bribery provision for federal
officials. Section 201(b) similarly makes it a crime for federal
officials to “corruptly” accept a payment “in return for” “being
influenced” in an official act.[2] By contrast, §666 bears little resemblance to §201(c),
the gratuities provision for federal officials, which contains no
express mens rea requirements and simply makes it a crime
for federal officials to accept a payment “for or because of any
official act.”[3]

															Therefore, the dividing line between §201(b)’s
bribery provision and §201(c)’s gratuities provision is that
bribery requires that the official have a corrupt state of mind and
accept (or agree to accept) the payment intending to be influenced
in the official act. See United States v. Sun-Diamond
Growers of Cal., 526 U.S.
398, 404–405 (1999). Section 666 shares the defining
characteristics of §201(b)’s bribery provision: the corrupt state
of mind and the intent to be influenced in the official act. The
statutory text therefore strongly suggests that §666—like
§201(b)—is a bribery statute, not a gratuities statute.

															Second is the statutory history, which
reinforces that textual analysis. In 1984, when first enacting §666
for state and local officials, Congress borrowed language from the
gratuities statute for federal officials, §201(c). See 18
U. S. C. §666(b) (1982 ed., Supp. II). But just two years
later, in 1986, Congress overhauled §666, eliminated the gratuities
language, and instead enacted the current language that resembles
the bribery provision for federal officials, §201(b). Perhaps
Congress in 1986 concluded that federally criminalizing state and
local gratuities would significantly intrude on federalism.
Whatever the impetus, we know that Congress decided in 1986 to
change the law and to model §666 on §201(b), the bribery statute,
and not on §201(c), the gratuities statute. It therefore would be
strange to interpret §666, as the Government suggests, to mean the
same thing now that it meant back in 1984, before the 1986
amendment. We must respect Congress’s choice in 1986.

															Third is the statutory structure. The
Government posits that Congress prohibited bribes and gratuities to
state and local officials in a single statutory provision,
§666(a)(1)(B). Such a statute would be highly unusual, if not
unique. The Government identifies no other provision in the
U. S. Code that prohibits bribes and gratuities in the same
provision.[4] That is because
bribery and gratuities are “two separate crimes” with “two
different sets of elements.” Sun-Diamond, 526 U. S., at
404. Therefore, §201(b) makes it a crime for federal officials to
accept bribes, while a separate provision, §201(c), makes it a
crime for federal officials to accept certain gratuities. The
absence of a separate gratuities provision in §666 reinforces that
§666 is a bribery statute for state and local officials, not a
two-for-one bribery-and-gratuities statute.

															Fourth are the statutory punishments. For
federal officials, Congress has separated bribery and gratuities
into two distinct provisions of §201 for good reason: The crimes
receive different punishments that “reflect their relative
seriousness.” Sun-Diamond, 526 U. S., at 405. For
example, accepting a bribe as a federal official is punishable by
up to 15 years in prison, while accepting an illegal gratuity as a
federal official is punishable by only up to 2 years. Compare
§201(b) with §201(c).

															If the Government were correct that §666 also
covered gratuities, Congress would have created an entirely
inexplicable regime for state and local officials. For one, even
though bribery has been treated as a far more serious offense,
Congress would have authorized the same 10-year maximum sentences
for (i) gratuities to state and local officials and
(ii) bribes to state and local officials. See
Sun-Diamond, 526 U. S., at 405. In addition, Congress would
have authorized punishing gratuities to state and local officials
five times more severely than gratuities to federal officials—10
years for state and local officials compared to 2 years for federal
officials.

															The Government cannot explain why Congress would
have created such substantial sentencing disparities. We cannot
readily assume that Congress authorized a 2-year sentence for, say,
a Cabinet Secretary who accepts an unlawful gratuity while
authorizing a 10-year sentence on a local school board member who
accepts an identical gratuity. What sense would that make? In
short, the inexplicable anomalies ushered in by the Government’s
approach powerfully demonstrate that §666 is a bribery statute.

															Fifth is federalism. Interpreting §666 as
a gratuities statute would significantly infringe on bedrock
federalism principles. As this Court has long recognized, a State
“defines itself as a sovereign through the structure of its
government, and the character of those who exercise government
authority.” McDonnell v. United States, 579
U.S. 550, 576 (2016) (quotation marks omitted). Therefore, as a
general matter, States have the “prerogative to regulate the
permissible scope of interactions between state officials and their
constituents.” Ibid.; see United States v.
Bass, 404 U.S.
336, 350 (1971).

															As noted above, state and local governments have
adopted a variety of approaches to regulating state and local
officials’ acceptance of gratuities. See supra, at 2–4.
Those differing approaches reflect nuanced state and local policy
judgments about when gifts expressing appreciation to public
officials for their past acts cross the line from the innocuous to
the problematic.

															The carefully calibrated policy decisions that
the States and local governments have made about gratuities would
be gutted if we were to accept the Government’s interpretation of
§666. After all, §666 covers virtually all state and local
officials—about 19 million nationwide. So reading §666 to create a
federal prohibition on gratuities would suddenly subject 19 million
state and local officials to a new and different regulatory regime
for gratuities. In other words, a county official could
meticulously comply with her county’s local gratuities rules—say,
by declining a $200 gift card but accepting a $100 gift card from a
neighbor as thanks for her diligent work on a new park—but still
face up to 10 years in federal prison because she accepted a thing
of value in connection with an official act.

															We should hesitate before concluding that
Congress prohibited gratuities that state and local governments
have allowed for their officials. After all, Congress does not
lightly override state and local governments on such core matters
of state and local governance. And the principle articulated by
this Court in Sun-Diamond fits this case as well: A “narrow,
rather than a sweeping, prohibition is more compatible with the
fact that” this statute “is merely one strand of an intricate web
of regulations, both administrative and criminal, governing the
acceptance of gifts and other self-enriching actions by public
officials.” 526 U. S., at 409.

															In short, federalism principles weigh heavily in
favor of reading §666 as a bribery statute and not as a gratuities
law.

															Sixth is fair notice. The Government’s
interpretation of the statute would create traps for unwary state
and local officials. Sun-Diamond, 526 U. S., at
411.

															The Government had to choose between two options
for how to read §666. The Government could read §666 to ban all
gratuities, no matter how trivial, in connection with covered
official acts. That option might be clear enough. But that
draconian approach would border on the absurd and exacerbate the
already serious federalism problems with the Government’s reading
of §666.

															Alternatively, the Government could recognize
the irrationality of reading §666 to criminalize all such
gratuities. And to deal with the overbreadth problems, the
Government could make atextual exceptions on the fly.

															The Government opted for the second approach,
seeking to soothe concerns about overbreadth by saying that the
statute, even under its view, would not cover “innocuous” or
“obviously benign” gratuities. Brief for United States 39; Tr. of
Oral Arg. 41, 45–49.

															But that effort to address those overbreadth
concerns has simply moved the Government from one sinkhole to
another. The flaw in the Government’s approach—and it is a very
serious real-world problem—is that the Government does not identify
any remotely clear lines separating an innocuous or obviously
benign gratuity from a criminal gratuity. The Government simply
opines that state and local officials may not accept “wrongful”
gratuities. Brief for United States 39; Tr. of Oral Arg. 46.

															That is no guidance at all. Is a $100 Dunkin’
Donuts gift card for a trash collector wrongful? What about a $200
Nike gift card for a county commissioner who voted to fund new
school athletic facilities? Could students take their college
professor out to Chipotle for an end-of-term celebration? And if
so, would it somehow become criminal to take the professor for a
steak dinner? Or to treat her to a Hoosiers game?

															The Government offers no clear federal rules for
state and local officials. So how are state legislators, city
council members, school board officials, building code inspectors,
probation officers, human resource directors, police officers,
librarians, snow plow drivers, court clerks, prison guards, high
school basketball coaches, mayors, zoning board members, animal
control officers, social workers, firefighters, city planners, and
the entire army of 19 million state and local officials to know
what is acceptable and what is criminalized by the Federal
Government? They cannot. The Government’s so-called guidance would
leave state and local officials entirely at sea to guess about what
gifts they are allowed to accept under federal law, with the threat
of up to 10 years in federal prison if they happen to guess wrong.
That is not how federal criminal law works.[5]

															Responding to the legitimate concern that the
federal lines are unknown and unknowable to state and local
officials, the Government advances the familiar plea that federal
prosecutors can be trusted not to enforce this statute against
small-time violators. But as this Court has said time and again,
the Court “cannot construe a criminal statute on the assumption
that the Government will use it responsibly.” McDonnell, 579
U. S., at 576 (quotation marks omitted); see Percoco v.
United States, 598 U.S. 319 (2023); Ciminelli v.
United States, 598 U.S. 306 (2023); Kelly v.
United States, 590 U.S. 391 (2020); Skilling v.
United States, 561 U.S.
358 (2010).

															The lack of fair notice for state and local
officials is highlighted by comparing the non-existent federal
gratuities guidance given to state and local officials with the
extensive federal gratuities guidance given to federal workers. The
Office of Government Ethics has promulgated comprehensive and
detailed regulatory guidelines specifying what gifts are allowed
and prohibited for federal workers. For instance, the guidelines
for federal officials set forth cost thresholds, exempt certain
gifts from friends or family, clarify what discounts are
acceptable, and explain which social invitations an official may
accept—all with multiple examples to guide federal officials’
conduct. See 5 CFR §2635.204.

															Nothing for state and local officials. It is
unfathomable that Congress would authorize a 10-year criminal
sentence for gifts to 19 million state and local officials without
any coherent federal guidance (or any federal guidance at all)
about how an official can distinguish the innocuous from the
criminal.

															When construing a statute like this that
regulates state and local officials, this Court’s precedents
caution against leaving the statute’s “outer boundaries ambiguous”
and involving the “Federal Government in setting standards of good
government for local and state officials.” McDonnell, 579
U. S., at 577 (quotation marks omitted). And the Court has
emphasized that a “statute in this field that can linguistically be
interpreted to be either a meat axe or a scalpel should reasonably
be taken to be the latter.” Sun-Diamond, 526 U. S., at
412. So it is here.

															B

															Faced with that phalanx of difficulties with its
interpretation of §666, the Government offers little. The
Government’s argument boils down to one main point—that §666 uses
the term “rewarded” as well as “influenced.” And that, too, is the
dissent’s main point. The Government (echoed by the dissent) says
that Congress would not have added the term “rewarded” to
“influenced” in §666 if the statute were meant to cover only bribes
and not also gratuities. That argument is misconceived.

															In isolation, the word “rewarded” could be part
of a gratuities statute or a bribery statute—either (i) a
reward given after the act with no agreement beforehand (gratuity)
or (ii) a reward given after the act pursuant to an agreement
beforehand (bribe). But as noted above, the word “corruptly” in the
text of §666 helps resolve the issue here. The bribery statute for
federal officials, §201(b), uses the term “corruptly.” But the
gratuities statute for federal officials, §201(c), does not. The
term “corruptly” therefore signals that §666 is a bribery statute.
And statutory history, statutory structure, statutory punishments,
federalism, and fair notice strongly reinforce that textual signal
and together establish that §666 is a bribery statute.

															Contrary to the premise of the Government’s
argument, moreover, bribery statutes sometimes use the term
“reward.” See, e.g., 18 U. S. C. §600; 33
U. S. C. §447. The term “rewarded” closes off certain
defenses that otherwise might be raised in bribery cases. Consider
a bribe where the agreement was made before the act but the payment
was made after the act. An official might try to defend against the
bribery charge by saying that the payment was received only after
the official act and therefore could not have “influenced” the act.
By including the term “rewarded,” Congress made clear that the
timing of the agreement is the key, not the timing of the payment,
and thereby precluded such a potential defense.

															And think about the official who took a bribe
before the official act but asserts as a defense that he would have
taken the same act anyway and therefore was not “influenced” by the
payment. To shut the door on that potential defense to a §666
bribery charge, Congress sensibly added the term “rewarded.”

															So even if “influenced” alone might have covered
the waterfront of bribes, adding “rewarded” made good sense to
avoid potential ambiguities, gaps, or loopholes. Congress commonly
writes federal statutes, including bribery statutes, in such a belt
and suspenders manner. Here, the term “rewarded” does not transform
§666 into a gratuities statute.

															In sum, §666 tracks §201(b), the bribery
provision for federal officials. A state or local official can
violate §666 when he accepts an up-front payment for a future
official act or agrees to a future reward for a future official
act. See United States v. Fernandez, 722 F.3d 1, 23
(CA1 2013) (the word “reward” “clarifies that a bribe can be
promised before, but paid after, the official’s action” (quotation
marks omitted)). But a state or local official does not violate
§666 if the official has taken the official act before any reward
is agreed to, much less given. Although a gratuity offered and
accepted after the official act may be unethical or illegal under
other federal, state, or local laws, the gratuity does not violate
§666.

															*  *  *

															The Government asks this Court to adopt an
interpretation of §666 that would radically upend gratuities rules
and turn §666 into a vague and unfair trap for 19 million state and
local officials. We decline to do so. Section 666 is a vital
statute, but its focus is targeted: Section 666 proscribes bribes
to state and local officials, while allowing state and local
governments to regulate gratuities to state and local officials.
Within constitutional bounds, Congress can always change the law if
it wishes to do so. But since 1986, it has not, presumably because
Congress understands that state and local governments may and often
do regulate gratuities to state and local officials. We reverse the
judgment of the U. S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit
and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this
opinion.

															It is so ordered.

provides: “Whoever . . . being an agent of an
organization, or of a State, local, or Indian tribal government, or
any agency thereof [that receives more than $10,000 in federal
funds annually] corruptly solicits or demands for the benefit of
any person, or accepts or agrees to accept, anything of value from
any person, intending to be influenced or rewarded in connection
with any business, transaction, or series of transactions of such
organization, government, or agency involving any thing of value of
$5,000 or more; . . . shall be fined under this title,
imprisoned not more than 10 years, or both.”

 Section 201(b)(2)(A)
provides: “Whoever . . . being a public official or
person selected to be a public official, directly or indirectly,
corruptly demands, seeks, receives, accepts, or agrees to receive
or accept anything of value personally or for any other person or
entity, in return for: being influenced in the performance of any
official act; . . . shall be fined under this title or
not more than three times the monetary equivalent of the thing of
value, whichever is greater, or imprisoned for not more than
fifteen years, or both, and may be disqualified from holding any
office of honor, trust, or profit under the United
States.”

 Section 201(c)(1)(B)
provides: “Whoever otherwise than as provided by law for the proper
discharge of official duty . . . being a public official,
former public official, or person selected to be a public official,
otherwise than as provided by law for the proper discharge of
official duty, directly or indirectly demands, seeks, receives,
accepts, or agrees to receive or accept anything of value
personally for or because of any official act performed or to be
performed by such official or person . . . shall be fined
under this title or imprisoned for not more than two years, or
both.”

 At most, the Government
points to 18 U. S. C. §215(a)(2), which bars employees of
financial institutions from “corruptly” soliciting or accepting
“anything of value . . . intending to be influenced or
rewarded in connection with any business or transaction of such
institution.” That language simply mirrors §666’s language. But
because this Court has never interpreted §215 (and therefore has
never said whether §215 covers only bribery), that statute is a
null data point.

 The Government’s
interpretation seems all the more unbelievable because §666 applies
to the gift-givers as well as the state and local officials
accepting the gifts. Specifically, §666(a)(2) makes it a crime
punishable by 10 years’ imprisonment for someone to “corruptly”
offer or give “anything of value” to state and local officials
“with intent to influence or reward.” So under the Government’s
approach, families, students, constituents, and other members of
the public would be forced to guess whether they could even offer
(much less actually give) thank-you gift cards, steak dinners, or
Fever tickets to their garbage collectors, professors, or school
board members, for example.
