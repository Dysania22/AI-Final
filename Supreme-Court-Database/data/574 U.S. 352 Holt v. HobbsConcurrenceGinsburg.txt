															SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

															No. 13–6827

															GREGORY HOUSTON HOLT, aka ABDUL MAALIK MUHAMMAD, PETITIONER
v. RAY HOBBS, DIRECTOR, ARKANSAS DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTION,
et al.

															on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for
the eighth circuit

															[January 20, 2015]

															Justice Ginsburg, with whom Justice Sotomayor joins,
concurring.

															Unlike the exemption this Court approved in Burwell v.
Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc., 573 U. S. ___ (2014),
accommodating petitioner’s religious belief in this case would not
detrimentally affect others who do not share petitioner’s belief.
See id., at ___, ___–___, and n. 8, ___ (slip op., at
2, 7–8, and n. 8, 27) (Ginsburg, J., dissenting). On that
understanding, I join the Court’s opinion.
