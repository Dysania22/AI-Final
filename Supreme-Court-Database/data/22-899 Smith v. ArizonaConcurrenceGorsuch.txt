															SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

															_________________

															No. 22–899

															_________________

															JASON SMITH, PETITIONER v. ARIZONA

															on writ of certiorari to the court of appeals
of arizona, division one

															[June 21, 2024]

															

															Justice Gorsuch, concurring in part.

															I am pleased to join the Court’s opinion holding
that, when an expert presents another’s statements as the “basis”
for his own opinion, he is offering those statements for their
truth. See Parts I, II, and IV, ante.

															I cannot join, however, the Court’s discussion
in Part III about when an absent analyst’s statement might qualify
as “testimonial.” See ante, at 19–21. As the Court says,
“that issue is not now fit for our resolution.” Ante, at 19.
It was not part of the question presented for our review, nor was
it the focus of the decision below. Ante, at 19–20.
In fact, the State devoted so little attention to the “testimonial”
issue in the Arizona courts that any argument it might make on the
subject on remand may be forfeited. Ante, at 20. Further,
the Court’s thoughts on the subject are in no way necessary to the
resolution of today’s dispute. What makes a statement testimonial,
the Court notes, is an entirely “separate” issue. Ante, at
19.

															Nor am I entirely sure about the guidance found
in Part III. The Sixth Amendment protects the accused’s “right
. . . to be confronted with the witnesses against him.”
As the Court sees it, whether a statement being offered for its
truth and tendency to inculpate a defendant triggers that right
depends “on the ‘primary purpose’ of the statement, and in
particular on how it relates to a future criminal proceeding.”
Ante, at 19. I cannot help but wonder whether that is
correct.

															Just consider a few other possibilities. In
protecting the right to confront “witnesses,” perhaps the Sixth
Amendment reaches any “person who gives or furnishes evidence.”
United States v. Hubbell, 530 U.S.
27, 49–50 (2000) (Thomas, J., concurring) (discussing
founding-era meaning of the word “witness” in the Fifth Amendment);
see also id., at 50, n. 1. Or perhaps the Amendment
reaches all “those who ‘bear testimony.’ ” Crawford v.
Washington, 541 U.S.
36, 51 (2004) (quoting 2 N. Webster, An American Dictionary of
the English Language (1828)). Perhaps, too, a statement “bears
testimony” so long as it “explicitly or implicitly . . .
relate[s] a factual assertion or disclose[s] information.”
Doe v. United States, 487 U.S.
201, 210 (1988) (discussing what makes a statement
“testimonial” for purposes of the Fifth Amendment); see also 2
Webster, An American Dictionary (observing near the founding that
“testimony” could mean “evidence” and “proof of some fact” as well
as a “solemn declaration or affirmation” made to “establis[h] or
prov[e] some fact”). To my mind, all these questions (and maybe
others too) warrant careful exploration in a case that presents
them and, without more assurance, I worry that the Court’s proposed
“primary purpose” test may be a limitation of our own creation on
the confrontation right.

															I am concerned, as well, about the confusion a
“primary purpose” test may engender. Does it focus, for example, on
the purposes an objective observer would assign to a challenged
statement, see ante, at 3 (referencing the “ ‘objective
witness’ ”), the declarant’s purposes in making it, see
ante, at 21 (asking “why Rast created the report or notes”),
the government’s purposes in “ ‘procur[ing]’ ” it, see
ante, at 3, or maybe still some other point of reference?
Even after we figure out a statement’s purposes, how do we pick the
primary one out of the several a statement might serve? Or
determine in exactly what way that purpose must “relat[e] to a
future criminal proceeding”? Ante, at 19. And if we fail to
find some foothold in text and historical practice for resolving
these questions, how can judges answer them without resort to their
own notions of what would be best?

															Some time ago, Chief Justice Marshall charged
the judiciary with “be[ing] watchful of every inroad” on the
accused’s right to be confronted with the witnesses against him.
United States v. Burr, 25 F. Cas. 187, 193 (No.
14,694) (CC Va. 1807). With that cautionary note in mind, I
respectfully concur in all but Part III of the Court’s opinion.
