															COINBASE, INC., PETITIONER v. DAVID
SUSKI, et al.

															on writ of certiorari to the united states
court of appeals for the ninth circuit

															[May 23, 2024]

															Justice Jackson delivered the opinion of the
Court.

															The parties in this case executed two contracts.
The first contained an arbitration provision with a delegation
clause; per that provision, an arbitrator must decide all disputes
under the contract, including whether a given disagreement is
arbitrable. The second contract contained a forum selection clause,
providing that all disputes related to that contract must be
decided in California courts. Coinbase insists that the first
contract’s delegation clause established the terms by which all
subsequent disputes were to be resolved, so the arbitrability of a
contract-related dispute between these parties is a matter for the
arbitrator to decide. But respondents maintain—and the Ninth
Circuit held—that the second contract’s forum selection clause
superseded that prior agreement. This case thus presents the
following question: When two such contracts exist, who decides the
arbitrability of a contract-related dispute between the parties—an
arbitrator or the court?

															Basic legal principles establish the answer.
Arbitration is a matter of contract and consent, and we have long
held that disputes are subject to arbitration if, and only if, the
parties actually agreed to arbitrate those disputes. Here, then,
before either the delegation provision or the forum selection
clause can be enforced, a court needs to decide what the parties
have agreed to—i.e., which contract controls. Accordingly,
we affirm the judgment of the Ninth Circuit.

															I

															Coinbase, Inc., operates a cryptocurrency
exchange platform. Respondents are users of Coinbase. To buy and
sell cryptocurrency on the platform, users create accounts.

															The first relevant contract is the Coinbase User
Agreement that respondents agreed to when they created their
accounts. The User Agreement contains a provision that the contract
calls the Arbitration Agreement. 1 App. 218. The Arbitration
Agreement includes a delegation clause:

															“This Arbitration Agreement includes,
without limitation, disputes arising out of or related to the
interpretation or application of the Arbitration Agreement,
including the enforceability, revocability, scope, or validity of
the Arbitration Agreement or any portion of the Arbitration
Agreement. All such matters shall be decided by an arbitrator
and not by a court or judge.” Ibid. (emphasis
added).

															Respondents each agreed to the User Agreement,
complete with the above-quoted arbitration language. If that were
the only contract at issue, we would not be deciding this case,
since the Arbitration Agreement quite clearly sends to arbitration
disputes between Coinbase and its users, including disputes about
arbitrability.

															These parties, though, agreed to a second
contract. Coinbase offered a sweepstakes that users could enter for
a chance to win a cryptocurrency called Dogecoin. Respondents each
submitted entries in June 2021, and in doing so, agreed to the
Official Rules of the sweepstakes. Unlike the User Agreement, the
Official Rules contained a forum selection clause, which
provided:

															“The California courts (state and federal)
shall have sole jurisdiction of any controversies regarding the
[sweepstakes] promotion and the laws of the state of California
shall govern the promotion. Each entrant waives any and all
objections to jurisdiction and venue in those courts for any reason
and hereby submits to the jurisdiction of those courts.”
Id., at 108 (capitalization altered).

															Thus, after respondents entered the sweepstakes,
the parties had executed two contracts: the User Agreement, which
sent disputes about arbitrability to arbitration, and the Official
Rules, which appeared to send disputes to California courts.

															Once the sweepstakes concluded, the conflict
between these contracts came to a head. Respondents filed a
class-action complaint in the U. S. District Court for the
Northern District of California, alleging that the sweepstakes
violated California’s False Advertising Law, Unfair Competition
Law, and Consumer Legal Remedies Act. Invoking the User Agreement
and its delegation clause, Coinbase moved to compel
arbitration.

															The District Court denied Coinbase’s motion. It
reasoned that deciding which contract governed was a question for
the court; that the User Agreement’s arbitration provision
conflicted with the forum selection clause in the Official Rules;
and that, under California contract law, the Official Rules
superseded the User Agreement. The District Court therefore
determined that the Official Rules’ forum selection clause
controlled, so the parties’ sweepstakes-related dispute was not
subject to arbitration. The Ninth Circuit affirmed. 55 F. 4th
1227 (2022).

															We granted certiorari to answer the question of
who—a judge or an arbitrator—should decide whether a subsequent
contract supersedes an earlier arbitration agreement that contains
a delegation clause. 601 U. S. ___ (2023).

															II

															The Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) “reflects
the fundamental principle that arbitration is a matter of
contract.” Rent-A-Center, West, Inc. v. Jackson,
561 U.S.
63, 67 (2010). As a result, arbitration agreements are “valid,
irrevocable, and enforceable, save upon such grounds as exist at
law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.” 9
U. S. C. §2. If a court is “satisfied that the making of
the agreement for arbitration . . . is not in issue,” it
must send the dispute to an arbitrator. §4. “The FAA thereby places
arbitration agreements on an equal footing with other contracts.”
Rent-A-Center, 561 U. S., at 67.

															Given that arbitration agreements are simply
contracts, “ ‘[t]he first principle that underscores all of
our arbitration decisions’ is that ‘[a]rbitration is strictly a
matter of consent.’ ” Lamps Plus, Inc. v.
Varela, 587 U.S. 176, 184 (2019) (quoting Granite Rock
Co. v. Teamsters, 561 U.S.
287, 299 (2010); some alterations in original). Arbitration is
“a way to resolve those disputes—but only those disputes—that the
parties have agreed to submit to arbitration.” First Options of
Chicago, Inc. v. Kaplan, 514 U.S.
938, 943 (1995). Consequently, the first question in any
arbitration dispute must be: What have these parties agreed to?

															As relevant here, parties can form multiple
levels of agreements concerning arbitration. At a basic level,
parties can agree to send the merits of a dispute to an arbitrator.
They can also “agree by contract that an arbitrator, rather than a
court, will resolve threshold arbitrability questions as well as
underlying merits disputes.” Henry Schein, Inc. v. Archer
& White Sales, Inc., 586 U.S. 63, 65 (2019). An agreement
to allow an arbitrator to decide whether a dispute is subject to
arbitration—i.e., its arbitrability—“is simply an
additional, antecedent agreement . . . , and the FAA
operates on this additional arbitration agreement just as it does
on any other.” Rent-A-Center, 561 U. S., at 70.

															From these different kinds of agreements, it
follows that parties can also have different kinds of disputes. A
contest over “the merits of the dispute” is a first-order
disagreement, First Options, 514 U. S., at 942
(emphasis deleted), the resolution of which depends on the
applicable law and relevant facts. The parties may also have a
second-order dispute—“whether they agreed to arbitrate the
merits”—as well as a third-order dispute—“who should have the
primary power to decide the second matter.” Ibid. (emphasis
deleted). Under contract principles, these second- and third-order
questions are also matters of consent. “Just as the arbitrability
of the merits of a dispute depends upon whether the parties agreed
to arbitrate that dispute, so the question ‘who has the primary
power to decide arbitrability’ turns upon what the parties agreed
about that matter.” Id., at 943 (citations
omitted).

															We ask who has the power to decide arbitrability
because “a party who has not agreed to arbitrate will normally have
a right to the court’s decision about the merits of its dispute.”
Id., at 942. Thus, we have explained that “[c]ourts should
not assume that the parties agreed to arbitrate arbitrability
unless there is ‘clea[r] and unmistakabl[e]’ evidence that they did
so.” Id., at 944 (quoting AT&T Technologies, Inc.
v. Communications Workers, 475 U.S.
643, 649 (1986); some alterations in original). “[B]efore
referring a dispute to an arbitrator,” therefore, “the court
determines whether a valid arbitration agreement exists.” Henry
Schein, 586 U. S., at 69.

															III

															In prior cases, we have addressed three layers
of arbitration disputes: (1) merits, (2) arbitrability, and (3) who
decides arbitrability. This case involves a fourth: What happens if
parties have multiple agreements that conflict as to the
third-order question of who decides arbitrability? As always,
traditional contract principles apply.

															Coinbase says the User Agreement’s delegation
clause controls. Respondents counter that the Official Rules’ forum
selection clause superseded that agreement. If Coinbase is right
that the User Agreement’s delegation clause was meant to govern all
agreements moving forward, then the parties agreed to arbitrate all
subsequent arbitrability disputes. If respondents are correct that
the Official Rules’ forum selection clause superseded the User
Agreement’s delegation clause, then the parties meant to send
sweepstakes disputes—including those over arbitrability—to
California courts.

															Thus, the question whether these parties agreed
to arbitrate arbitrability can be answered only by determining
which contract applies. In other words, “the substance of the
parties’ supersession dispute is ‘whether there is an agreement to
arbitrate.’ ” Field Intelligence Inc. v. Xylem
Dewatering Solutions Inc., 49 F. 4th 351, 356 (CA3 2022). When
we home in on the conflict between the delegation clause in the
first contract and forum selection clause in the second, the
question is whether the parties agreed to send the given dispute to
arbitration—and, per usual, that question must be answered
by a court.

															Coinbase seems to concede this point. See Reply
Brief 12 (“Coinbase agrees that the Court can and should assess
whether the official rules displaced the parties’ consent to have
an arbitrator decide arbitrability”). Nevertheless, it offers a
slew of reasons why we should revisit the Ninth Circuit’s
bottom-line conclusion. None of these reasons persuades us to do
so.

															First, Coinbase invokes the so-called
severability principle. Under the severability principle, “an
arbitration [or delegation] provision is severable from the
remainder of the contract,” and “unless the challenge is to the
arbitration [or delegation] clause itself, the issue of the
contract’s validity is considered by the arbitrator in the first
instance.” Buckeye Check Cashing, Inc. v. Cardegna,
546 U.S.
440, 445–446 (2006). Coinbase argues that, pursuant to this
principle, the Ninth Circuit should have isolated the User
Agreement’s delegation provision and considered only arguments
specific to that provision.

															Assuming without deciding that the severability
principle is implicated here, it is nonetheless satisfied. The
severability principle establishes that a party seeking to avoid
arbitration must directly challenge the arbitration or delegation
clause, not just the contract as a whole. But this rule does not
require that a party challenge only the arbitration or
delegation provision. Rather, where a challenge applies “equally”
to the whole contract and to an arbitration or delegation
provision, a court must address that challenge.
Rent-A-Center, 561 U. S., at 71. Again, basic
principles of contract and consent require that result. Arbitration
and delegation agreements are simply contracts, and, normally, if a
party says that a contract is invalid, the court must address that
argument before deciding the merits of the contract dispute. So too
here. “If a party challenges the validity . . . of the
precise agreement to arbitrate at issue, the federal court
must consider the challenge before ordering compliance with
that [arbitration] agreement.” Ibid. (emphasis
added).[1]*

															Next, Coinbase contends that, as a matter of
California law, the Ninth Circuit was wrong to hold that the
Official Rules’ forum selection clause superseded the User
Agreement’s delegation provision. That issue is outside the scope
of the question presented, and we do not address it. We took this
case to decide whether, under the FAA, a court or an arbitrator
decides which of the two contractual provisions controls. We
decline to consider auxiliary questions about whether the Ninth
Circuit properly applied state law.

															Finally, Coinbase contends that our approach
will invite chaos by facilitating challenges to delegation clauses.
We do not believe that such chaos will follow. In cases where
parties have agreed to only one contract, and that contract
contains an arbitration clause with a delegation provision, then,
absent a successful challenge to the delegation provision, courts
must send all arbitrability disputes to arbitration. But, where, as
here, parties have agreed to two contracts—one sending
arbitrability disputes to arbitration, and the other either
explicitly or implicitly sending arbitrability disputes to the
courts—a court must decide which contract governs. To hold
otherwise would be to impermissibly “ ‘elevate [a delegation
provision] over other forms of contract.’ ” Ibid.
(quoting Prima Paint Corp. v. Flood & Conklin Mfg.
Co., 388 U.S.
395, 404, n. 12 (1967)).

															*  *  *

															We conclude that a court, not an arbitrator,
must decide whether the parties’ first agreement was superseded by
their second. The Ninth Circuit’s judgment is affirmed.

															

															It is so ordered.

Notes
1
*Coinbase’s argument that
respondents failed to challenge the delegation provision in the
District Court is itself forfeited. Coinbase did not raise that
argument before the Ninth Circuit, and the Ninth Circuit did not
address it. That argument is also meritless: When opposing
Coinbase’s motion to compel arbitration in the District Court,
respondents pointed out that “courts can refer the question of
arbitrability to an arbitrator only ‘if a valid [arbitration]
agreement exists,’ ” and, “since Official Rules ¶10
‘superseded’ the parties’ prior arbitration agreements, any prior
agreement to arbitrate Sweepstakes-related disputes no
longer exists.” 2 App. 451 (alteration in original). Respondents’
District Court challenge was “directed specifically to” the
delegation provision. Rent-A-Center, 561 U. S., at 71.
Thus, this case is not like Rent-A-Center, where the
plaintiff “did [not] even mention the delegation provision.”
Id., at 72.
