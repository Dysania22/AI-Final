															SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

															JASON SMITH, PETITIONER v. ARIZONA

															on writ of certiorari to the court of appeals
of arizona, division one

															[June 21, 2024]

															

															Justice Thomas, concurring in part.

															I join the Court in all but Part III of its
opinion. The Sixth Amendment’s Confrontation Clause provides: “In
all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right
. . . to be confronted with the witnesses against him.”
This Clause bars the admission of an absent witness’s testimonial
statements for their truth, unless the witness is unavailable and
the defendant previously had an opportunity to cross-examine that
witness. See Crawford v. Washington, 541 U.S.
36, 50–56, 60, n. 9 (2004). Today, the Court correctly
concludes that “[w]hen an expert conveys an absent analyst’s
statements in support of his opinion, and the statements provide
that support only if true, then the statements come into evidence
for their truth.” Ante, at 2; see also Williams v.
Illinois, 567 U.S.
50, 106 (2012) (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment). But, a
question remains whether that analyst’s statements were
testimonial. I agree with the Court that, because the courts below
did not consider this question, we should remand for the Arizona
Court of Appeals to answer it in the first instance. Ante,
at 19–20. But, I disagree with the Court’s suggestion that the
Arizona Court of Appeals should answer that question by looking to
each statement’s “primary purpose.” Ante, at 20–21.

															I continue to adhere to my view that “the
Confrontation Clause is implicated by extrajudicial statements only
insofar as they are contained in formalized testimonial materials,
such as affidavits, depositions, prior testimony, or
confessions.” [1]*
White v. Illinois, 502 U.S.
346, 365 (1992) (Thomas, J., concurring in part and concurring
in judgment); see also Ohio v. Clark, 576 U.S.
237, 254–255 (2015) (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment);
Williams, 567 U. S., at 110–111 (opinion of Thomas,
J.); Michigan v. Bryant, 562
U.S. 344, 379 (2011) (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment);
Melendez-Diaz v. Massachusetts, 557 U.S.
305, 329 (2009) (Thomas, J., concurring); Giles v.
California, 554 U.S.
353, 377–378 (2008) (Thomas, J., concurring); Davis v.
Washington, 547 U.S.
813, 837 (2006) (opinion of Thomas, J.); Lilly v.
Virginia, 527 U.S.
116, 143 (1999) (Thomas, J., concurring in part and concurring
in judgment). The Confrontation Clause guarantees a criminal
defendant “the right . . . to be confronted with the
witnesses against him.” Amdt. 6. As I have previously explained,
“[w]itnesses . . . are those who bear testimony. And
testimony is a solemn declaration or affirmation made for the
purpose of establishing or proving some fact.” Davis, 547
U. S., at 836 (opinion of Thomas, J.) (citation, internal
quotation marks, and alterations omitted). This understanding is
grounded in “[t]he history surrounding the right to confrontation,”
which “was developed to target particular practices that occurred
under the English bail and committal statutes passed during the
reign of Queen Mary, namely, the civil-law mode of criminal
procedure, and particularly its use of ex parte
examinations as evidence against the accused.” Id., at 835
(internal quotation marks omitted). Rather than attempt to divine a
statement’s “primary purpose,” I would look for whether the
statement is “similar in solemnity to the Marian examination
practices that the Confrontation Clause was designed to prevent.”
Williams, 567 U. S., at 112 (opinion of Thomas, J.). In
my view, the Arizona Court of Appeals should consider on remand
whether the statements at issue have the requisite formality and
solemnity to qualify as testimonial. If they do not, the
Confrontation Clause poses no barrier to their admission.

Notes

*The Confrontation Clause “also
reaches the use of technically informal statements when used to
evade the formalized process.” Davis v. Washington,
547 U.S.
813, 838 (2006) (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment in part and
dissenting in part).
