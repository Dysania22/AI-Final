															SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

															_________________

															No. 22–976

															_________________

															MERRICK B. GARLAND, ATTORNEY GENERAL, et al.,
PETITIONERS v. MICHAEL CARGILL

															on writ of certiorari to the united states
court of appeals for the fifth circuit

															[June 14, 2024]

															

															Justice Alito, concurring.

															I join the opinion of the Court because there is
simply no other way to read the statutory language. There can be
little doubt that the Congress that enacted 26 U. S. C.
§5845(b) would not have seen any material difference between a
machinegun and a semiautomatic rifle equipped with a bump stock.
But the statutory text is clear, and we must follow it.

															The horrible shooting spree in Las Vegas in 2017
did not change the statutory text or its meaning. That event
demonstrated that a semiautomatic rifle with a bump stock can have
the same lethal effect as a machinegun, and it thus strengthened
the case for amending §5845(b). But an event that highlights the
need to amend a law does not itself change the law’s meaning.

															There is a simple remedy for the disparate
treatment of bump stocks and machineguns. Congress can amend the
law—and perhaps would have done so already if ATF had stuck with
its earlier interpretation. Now that the situation is clear,
Congress can act.
