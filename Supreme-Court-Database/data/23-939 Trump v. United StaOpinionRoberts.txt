															DONALD J. TRUMP, PETITIONER v. UNITED
STATES

															on writ of certiorari to the united states
court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit

															[July 1, 2024]

															

															Chief Justice Roberts delivered the opinion of
the Court.

															This case concerns the federal indictment of a
former President of the United States for conduct alleged to
involve official acts during his tenure in office. We consider the
scope of a President’s immunity from criminal prosecution.

															I

															From January 2017 until January 2021, Donald
J. Trump served as President of the United States. On August 1,
2023, a federal grand jury indicted him on four counts for conduct
that occurred during his Presidency following the November 2020
election. The indictment alleged that after losing that election,
Trump conspired to overturn it by spreading knowingly false claims
of election fraud to obstruct the collecting, counting, and
certifying of the election results.

															According to the indictment, Trump advanced his
goal through five primary means. First, he and his co-conspirators
“used knowingly false claims of election fraud to get state
legislators and election officials to . . . change
electoral votes for [Trump’s] opponent, Joseph R. Biden, Jr., to
electoral votes for [Trump].” App. 185, Indictment ¶10(a). Second,
Trump and his co-conspirators “organized fraudulent slates of
electors in seven targeted states” and “caused these fraudulent
electors to transmit their false certificates to the Vice President
and other government officials to be counted at the certification
proceeding on January 6.” Id., at 186, ¶10(b). Third, Trump
and his co-conspirators attempted to use the Justice Department “to
conduct sham election crime investigations and to send a letter to
the targeted states that falsely claimed that the Justice
Department had identified significant concerns that may have
impacted the election outcome.” Id., at 186–187, ¶10(c).
Fourth, Trump and his co-conspirators attempted to persuade “the
Vice President to use his ceremonial role at the January 6
certification proceeding to fraudulently alter the election
results.” Id., at 187, ¶10(d). And when that failed, on the
morning of January 6, they “repeated knowingly false claims of
election fraud to gathered supporters, falsely told them that the
Vice President had the authority to and might alter the election
results, and directed them to the Capitol to obstruct the
certification proceeding.” Ibid. Fifth, when “a large and
angry crowd . . . violently attacked the Capitol and
halted the proceeding,” Trump and his co-conspirators “exploited
the disruption by redoubling efforts to levy false claims of
election fraud and convince Members of Congress to further delay
the certification.” Id., at 187–188, ¶10(e).

															Based on this alleged conduct, the indictment
charged Trump with (1) conspiracy to defraud the United States in
violation of 18 U. S. C. §371, (2) conspiracy to obstruct
an official proceeding in violation of §1512(k), (3) obstruction of
and attempt to obstruct an official proceeding in violation of
§1512(c)(2), §2, and (4) conspiracy against rights in violation of
§241.[1]

															Trump moved to dismiss the indictment based on
Presidential immunity. In his view, the conduct alleged in the
indictment, properly characterized, was that while he was President
he (1) “made public statements about the administration of the
federal election”; (2) communicated with senior Justice Department
officials “about investigating election fraud and about choosing
the leadership” of the Department; (3) “communicated with state
officials about the administration of the federal election and
their exercise of official duties with respect to it”; (4)
“communicated with the Vice President” and with “Members of
Congress about the exercise of their official duties regarding the
election certification”; and (5) “authorized or directed others to
organize contingent slates of electors in furtherance of his
attempts to convince the Vice President to exercise his official
authority in a manner advocated for by President Trump.” Motion To
Dismiss Indictment Based on Presidential Immunity in No.
1:23–cr–00257 (DC), ECF Doc. 74, p. 9. Trump argued that all
of the indictment’s allegations fell within the core of his
official duties. Id., at 27. And he contended that a
President has absolute immunity from criminal prosecution for
actions performed within the outer perimeter of his official
responsibilities, to ensure that he can undertake the especially
sensitive duties of his office with bold and unhesitating action.
Id., at 14, 24.

															The District Court denied the motion to dismiss,
holding that “former Presidents do not possess absolute federal
criminal immunity for any acts committed while in office.” 2023 WL
8359833, *15 (DC, Dec. 1, 2023). The District Court recognized that
the President is immune from damages liability in civil cases, to
protect against the chilling effect such exposure might have on the
carrying out of his responsibilities. See Nixon v.
Fitzgerald, 457 U.S.
731, 749–756 (1982). But it reasoned that “the possibility of
vexatious post-Presidency litigation is much reduced in the
criminal context” in light of “[t]he robust procedural safeguards
attendant to federal criminal prosecutions.” 2023 WL 8359833,
*9–*10. The District Court declined to decide whether the indicted
conduct involved official acts. See id., at *15.

															The D. C. Circuit affirmed. 91 F. 4th
1173 (2024) (per curiam). Citing Marbury v.
Madison, 1 Cranch 137 (1803), the court distinguished
between two kinds of official acts: discretionary and ministerial.
91 F. 4th, at 1189–1190. It observed that “although
discretionary acts are ‘only politically examinable,’ the judiciary
has the power to hear cases” involving ministerial acts that an
officer is directed to perform by the legislature. Ibid.
(quoting Marbury, 1 Cranch, at 166). From this distinction,
the D. C. Circuit concluded that the “separation of powers
doctrine, as expounded in Marbury and its progeny,
necessarily permits the Judiciary to oversee the federal criminal
prosecution of a former President for his official acts because the
fact of the prosecution means that the former President has
allegedly acted in defiance of the Congress’s laws.” 91 F. 4th, at
1191. In the court’s view, the fact that Trump’s actions “allegedly
violated generally applicable criminal laws” meant that those
actions “were not properly within the scope of his lawful
discretion.” Id., at 1192. The D. C. Circuit thus
concluded that Trump had “no structural immunity from the charges
in the Indictment.” Ibid. Like the District Court, the
D. C. Circuit declined to analyze the actions described in the
indictment to determine whether they involved official acts. See
id., at 1205, n. 14.

															We granted certiorari to consider the following
question: “Whether and if so to what extent does a former President
enjoy presidential immunity from criminal prosecution for conduct
alleged to involve official acts during his tenure in office.” 601
U. S. ___ (2024).

															II

															This case is the first criminal prosecution in
our Nation’s history of a former President for actions taken during
his Presidency. We are called upon to consider whether and under
what circumstances such a prosecution may proceed.  Doing so
requires careful assessment of the scope of Presidential power
under the Constitution. We undertake that responsibility conscious
that we must not confuse “the issue of a power’s validity with the
cause it is invoked to promote,” but must instead focus on the
“enduring consequences upon the balanced power structure of our
Republic.” Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer,
343 U.S.
579, 634 (1952) (Jackson, J., concurring).

															The parties before us do not dispute that a
former President can be subject to criminal prosecution for
unofficial acts committed while in office. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 28.
They also agree that some of the conduct described in the
indictment includes actions taken by Trump in his unofficial
capacity. See id., at 28–30, 36–37, 124.

															They disagree, however, about whether a former
President can be prosecuted for his official actions. Trump
contends that just as a President is absolutely immune from civil
damages liability for acts within the outer perimeter of his
official responsibilities, Fitzgerald, 457 U. S., at
756, he must be absolutely immune from criminal prosecution for
such acts. Brief for Petitioner 10. And Trump argues that the bulk
of the indictment’s allegations involve conduct in his official
capacity as President. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 30–32. Although the
Government agrees that some official actions are included in the
indictment’s allegations, see id., at 125, it maintains that
a former President does not enjoy immunity from criminal
prosecution for any actions, regardless of how they are
characterized. See Brief for United States 9.

															We conclude that under our constitutional
structure of separated powers, the nature of Presidential power
requires that a former President have some immunity from criminal
prosecution for official acts during his tenure in office. At least
with respect to the President’s exercise of his core constitutional
powers, this immunity must be absolute. As for his remaining
official actions, he is also entitled to immunity. At the current
stage of proceedings in this case, however, we need not and do not
decide whether that immunity must be absolute, or instead whether a
presumptive immunity is sufficient.

															A

															Article II of the Constitution provides that
“[t]he executive Power shall be vested in a President of the United
States of America.” §1, cl. 1. The President’s duties are of
“unrivaled gravity and breadth.” Trump v. Vance, 591
U.S. 786, 800 (2020). They include, for instance, commanding the
Armed Forces of the United States; granting reprieves and pardons
for offenses against the United States; and appointing public
ministers and consuls, the Justices of this Court, and Officers of
the United States. See §2. He also has important foreign relations
responsibilities: making treaties, appointing ambassadors,
recognizing foreign governments, meeting foreign leaders,
overseeing international diplomacy and intelligence gathering, and
managing matters related to terrorism, trade, and immigration. See
§§2, 3. Domestically, he must “take Care that the Laws be
faithfully executed,” §3, and he bears responsibility for the
actions of the many departments and agencies within the Executive
Branch. He also plays a role in lawmaking by recommending to
Congress the measures he thinks wise and signing or vetoing the
bills Congress passes. See Art. I, §7, cl. 2; Art. II,
§3.

															No matter the context, the President’s authority
to act necessarily “stem[s] either from an act of Congress or from
the Constitution itself.” Youngstown, 343 U. S., at
585. In the latter case, the President’s authority is sometimes
“conclusive and preclusive.” Id., at 638 (Jackson, J.,
concurring). When the President exercises such authority, he may
act even when the measures he takes are “incompatible with the
expressed or implied will of Congress.” Id., at 637. The
exclusive constitutional authority of the President “disabl[es] the
Congress from acting upon the subject.” Id., at 637–638. And
the courts have “no power to control [the President’s] discretion”
when he acts pursuant to the powers invested exclusively in him by
the Constitution. Marbury, 1 Cranch, at 166.

															If the President claims authority to act but in
fact exercises mere “individual will” and “authority without law,”
the courts may say so. Youngstown, 343 U. S., at 655
(Jackson, J., concurring). In Youngstown, for instance, we
held that President Truman exceeded his constitutional authority
when he seized most of the Nation’s steel mills. See id., at
582–589 (majority opinion). But once it is determined that the
President acted within the scope of his exclusive authority, his
discretion in exercising such authority cannot be subject to
further judicial examination.

															The Constitution, for example, vests the “Power
to Grant Reprieves and Pardons for Offences against the United
States” in the President. Art. II, §2, cl. 1. During and
after the Civil War, President Lincoln offered a full pardon, with
restoration of property rights, to anyone who had “engaged in the
rebellion” but agreed to take an oath of allegiance to the Union.
United States v. Klein, 13 Wall. 128, 139–141 (1872).
But in 1870, Congress enacted a provision that prohibited using the
President’s pardon as evidence of restoration of property rights.
Id., at 143–144. Chief Justice Chase held the provision
unconstitutional because it “impair[ed] the effect of a pardon, and
thus infring[ed] the constitutional power of the Executive.”
Id., at 147. “To the executive alone is intrusted the power
of pardon,” and the “legislature cannot change the effect of such a
pardon any more than the executive can change a law.” Id.,
at 147–148. The President’s authority to pardon, in other words, is
“conclusive and preclusive,” “disabling the Congress from acting
upon the subject.” Youngstown, 343 U. S., at 637–638
(Jackson, J., concurring).

															Some of the President’s other constitutional
powers also fit that description. “The President’s power to
remove—and thus supervise—those who wield executive power on his
behalf,” for instance, “follows from the text of Article II.”
Seila Law LLC v. Consumer Financial Protection
Bureau, 591 U.S. 197, 204 (2020). We have thus held that
Congress lacks authority to control the President’s “unrestricted
power of removal” with respect to “executive officers of the United
States whom he has appointed.” Myers v. United
States, 272 U.S.
52, 106, 176 (1926); see Youngstown, 343 U. S., at
638, n. 4 (Jackson, J., concurring) (citing the President’s
“exclusive power of removal in executive agencies” as an example of
“conclusive and preclusive” constitutional authority); cf. Seila
Law, 591 U. S., at 215 (noting only “two exceptions to the
President’s unrestricted removal power”). The power “to control
recognition determinations” of foreign countries is likewise an
“exclusive power of the President.” Zivotofsky v.
Kerry, 576 U.S.
1, 32 (2015). Congressional commands contrary to the
President’s recognition determinations are thus invalid.
Ibid.

															Congress cannot act on, and courts cannot
examine, the President’s actions on subjects within his “conclusive
and preclusive” constitutional authority. It follows that an Act of
Congress—either a specific one targeted at the President or a
generally applicable one—may not criminalize the President’s
actions within his exclusive constitutional power. Neither may the
courts adjudicate a criminal prosecution that examines such
Presidential actions. We thus conclude that the President is
absolutely immune from criminal prosecution for conduct within his
exclusive sphere of constitutional authority.

															B

															But of course not all of the President’s
official acts fall within his “conclusive and preclusive”
authority. As Justice Robert Jackson recognized in
Youngstown, the President sometimes “acts pursuant to an
express or implied authorization of Congress,” or in a “zone of
twilight” where “he and Congress may have concurrent authority.”
343 U. S., at 635, 637 (concurring opinion). The reasons that
justify the President’s absolute immunity from criminal prosecution
for acts within the scope of his exclusive authority therefore do
not extend to conduct in areas where his authority is shared with
Congress.

															We recognize that only a limited number of our
prior decisions guide determination of the President’s immunity in
this context. That is because proceedings directly involving a
President have been uncommon in our Nation, and “decisions of the
Court in this area” have accordingly been “rare” and “episodic.”
Dames & Moore v. Regan, 453
U.S. 654, 661 (1981). To resolve the matter, therefore, we look
primarily to the Framers’ design of the Presidency within the
separation of powers, our precedent on Presidential immunity in the
civil context, and our criminal cases where a President resisted
prosecutorial demands for documents.

															1

															The President “occupies a unique position in
the constitutional scheme,” Fitzgerald, 457 U. S., at
749, as “the only person who alone composes a branch of
government,” Trump v. Mazars USA, LLP, 591
U.S. 848, 868 (2020). The Framers “sought to encourage energetic,
vigorous, decisive, and speedy execution of the laws by placing in
the hands of a single, constitutionally indispensable, individual
the ultimate authority that, in respect to the other branches, the
Constitution divides among many.” Clinton v. Jones,
520 U.S.
681, 712 (1997) (Breyer, J., concurring in judgment). They
“deemed an energetic executive essential to ‘the protection of the
community against foreign attacks,’ ‘the steady administration of
the laws,’ ‘the protection of property,’ and ‘the security of
liberty.’ ” Seila Law, 591 U. S., at 223–224
(quoting The Federalist No. 70, p. 471 (J. Cooke ed. 1961) (A.
Hamilton)). The purpose of a “vigorous” and “energetic” Executive,
they thought, was to ensure “good government,” for a “feeble
executive implies a feeble execution of the government.”
Id., at 471–472.

															The Framers accordingly vested the President
with “supervisory and policy responsibilities of utmost discretion
and sensitivity.” Fitzgerald, 457 U. S., at 750. He
must make “the most sensitive and far-reaching decisions entrusted
to any official under our constitutional system.” Id., at
752. There accordingly “exists the greatest public interest” in
providing the President with “ ‘the maximum ability to deal
fearlessly and impartially with’ the duties of his office.”
Ibid. (quoting Ferri v. Ackerman, 444 U.S.
193, 203 (1979)). Appreciating the “unique risks to the
effective functioning of government” that arise when the
President’s energies are diverted by proceedings that might render
him “unduly cautious in the discharge of his official duties,” we
have recognized Presidential immunities and privileges “rooted in
the constitutional tradition of the separation of powers and
supported by our history.” Fitzgerald, 457 U. S., at
749, 751, 752, n. 32.

															In Nixon v. Fitzgerald, for
instance, we recognized that as “a functionally mandated incident
of [his] unique office,” a former President “is entitled to
absolute immunity from damages liability predicated on his official
acts.” Id., at 749. That case involved a terminated Air
Force employee who sued former President Richard Nixon for damages,
alleging that Nixon approved an Air Force reorganization that
wrongfully led to his firing. In holding that Nixon was immune from
that suit, “our dominant concern” was to avoid “diversion of the
President’s attention during the decisionmaking process caused by
needless worry as to the possibility of damages actions stemming
from any particular official decision.” Clinton, 520
U. S., at 694, n. 19. “[T]he singular importance of the
President’s duties” implicating “matters likely to ‘arouse the most
intense feelings,’ ” coupled with “the sheer prominence of
[his] office,” heightens the prospect of private damages suits that
would threaten such diversion. Fitzgerald, 457 U. S.,
at 751–753 (quoting Pierson v. Ray, 386 U.S.
547, 554 (1967)). We therefore concluded that the President
must be absolutely immune from “damages liability for acts within
the ‘outer perimeter’ of his official responsibility.”
Fitzgerald, 457 U. S., at 756.

															By contrast, when prosecutors have sought
evidence from the President, we have consistently rejected
Presidential claims of absolute immunity. For instance, during the
treason trial of former Vice President Aaron Burr, Chief Justice
Marshall rejected President Thomas Jefferson’s claim that the
President could not be subjected to a subpoena. Marshall reasoned
that “the law does not discriminate between the president and a
private citizen.” United States v. Burr, 25 F. Cas.
30, 34 (No. 14,692d) (CC Va. 1807) (Burr I). Because a
President does not “stand exempt from the general provisions of the
constitution,” including the Sixth Amendment’s guarantee that those
accused shall have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses for
their defense, a subpoena could issue. Id., at 33–34.

															Marshall acknowledged, however, the existence of
a “privilege” to withhold certain “official paper[s]” that “ought
not on light ground to be forced into public view.” United
States v. Burr, 25 F. Cas. 187, 192 (No. 14,694) (CC Va.
1807) (Burr II); see also Burr I, 25 F. Cas., at
37 (stating that nothing before the court showed that the document
in question “contain[ed] any matter the disclosure of which would
endanger the public safety”). And he noted that a court may not “be
required to proceed against the president as against an ordinary
individual.” Burr II, 25 F. Cas., at 192.

															Similarly, when a subpoena issued to President
Nixon to produce certain tape recordings and documents relating to
his conversations with aides and advisers, this Court rejected his
claim of “absolute privilege,” given the “constitutional duty of
the Judicial Branch to do justice in criminal prosecutions.”
United States v. Nixon, 418 U.S.
683, 703, 707 (1974). But we simultaneously recognized “the
public interest in candid, objective, and even blunt or harsh
opinions in Presidential decisionmaking,” as well as the need to
protect “communications between high Government officials and those
who advise and assist them in the performance of their manifold
duties.” Id., at 705, 708. Because the President’s “need for
complete candor and objectivity from advisers calls for great
deference from the courts,” we held that a “presumptive privilege”
protects Presidential communications. Id., at 706, 708. That
privilege, we explained, “relates to the effective discharge of a
President’s powers.” Id., at 711. We thus deemed it
“fundamental to the operation of Government and inextricably rooted
in the separation of powers under the Constitution.” Id., at
708.

															2

															Criminally prosecuting a President for
official conduct undoubtedly poses a far greater threat of
intrusion on the authority and functions of the Executive Branch
than simply seeking evidence in his possession, as in Burr
and Nixon. The danger is akin to, indeed greater than, what
led us to recognize absolute Presidential immunity from civil
damages liability—that the President would be chilled from taking
the “bold and unhesitating action” required of an independent
Executive. Fitzgerald, 457 U. S., at 745. Although the
President might be exposed to fewer criminal prosecutions than the
range of civil damages suits that might be brought by various
plaintiffs, the threat of trial, judgment, and imprisonment is a
far greater deterrent. Potential criminal liability, and the
peculiar public opprobrium that attaches to criminal proceedings,
are plainly more likely to distort Presidential decisionmaking than
the potential payment of civil damages.

															The hesitation to execute the duties of his
office fearlessly and fairly that might result when a President is
making decisions under “a pall of potential prosecution,”
McDonnell v. United States, 579 U.S. 550, 575 (2016),
raises “unique risks to the effective functioning of government,”
Fitzgerald, 457 U. S., at 751. A President inclined to
take one course of action based on the public interest may instead
opt for another, apprehensive that criminal penalties may befall
him upon his departure from office. And if a former President’s
official acts are routinely subjected to scrutiny in criminal
prosecutions, “the independence of the Executive Branch” may be
significantly undermined. Vance, 591 U. S., at 800. The
Framers’ design of the Presidency did not envision such
counterproductive burdens on the “vigor[ ]” and “energy” of
the Executive. The Federalist No. 70, at 471–472.

															We must, however, “recognize[ ] the
countervailing interests at stake.” Vance, 591 U. S.,
at 799. Federal criminal laws seek to redress “a wrong to the
public” as a whole, not just “a wrong to the individual.”
Huntington v. Attrill, 146 U.S.
657, 668 (1892). There is therefore a compelling “public
interest in fair and effective law enforcement.” Vance, 591
U. S., at 808. The President, charged with enforcing federal
criminal laws, is not above them.

															Chief Justice Marshall’s decisions in
Burr and our decision in Nixon recognized the
distinct interests present in criminal prosecutions. Although
Burr acknowledged that the President’s official papers may
be privileged and publicly unavailable, it did not grant him an
absolute exemption from responding to subpoenas. See Burr
II, 25 F. Cas., at 192; Burr I, 25 F. Cas., at
33–34. Nixon likewise recognized a strong protection for the
President’s confidential communications—a “presumptive
privilege”—but it did not entirely exempt him from providing
evidence in criminal proceedings. 418 U. S., at 708.

															Taking into account these competing
considerations, we conclude that the separation of powers
principles explicated in our precedent necessitate at least a
presumptive immunity from criminal prosecution for a
President’s acts within the outer perimeter of his official
responsibility. Such an immunity is required to safeguard the
independence and effective functioning of the Executive Branch, and
to enable the President to carry out his constitutional duties
without undue caution. Indeed, if presumptive protection for the
President is necessary to enable the “effective discharge” of his
powers when a prosecutor merely seeks evidence of his official
papers and communications, id., at 711, it is certainly
necessary when the prosecutor seeks to charge, try, and imprison
the President himself for his official actions. At a minimum, the
President must therefore be immune from prosecution for an official
act unless the Government can show that applying a criminal
prohibition to that act would pose no “dangers of intrusion on the
authority and functions of the Executive Branch.”
Fitzgerald, 457 U. S., at 754.

															But as we explain below, the current stage of
the proceedings in this case does not require us to decide whether
this immunity is presumptive or absolute. See Part III–B,
infra. Because we need not decide that question today, we do
not decide it. “[O]ne case” in more than “two centuries does not
afford enough experience” to definitively and comprehensively
determine the President’s scope of immunity from criminal
prosecution. Mazars, 591 U. S., at 871.

															C

															As for a President’s unofficial acts, there is
no immunity. The principles we set out in Clinton v.
Jones confirm as much. When Paula Jones brought a civil
lawsuit against then-President Bill Clinton for acts he allegedly
committed prior to his Presidency, we rejected his argument that he
enjoyed temporary immunity from the lawsuit while serving as
President. 520 U. S., at 684. Although Presidential immunity
is required for official actions to ensure that the
President’s decisionmaking is not distorted by the threat of future
litigation stemming from those actions, that concern does not
support immunity for unofficial conduct. Id., at 694,
and n. 19. The “ ‘justifying purposes’ ” of the
immunity we recognized in Fitzgerald, and the one we
recognize today, are not that the President must be immune because
he is the President; rather, they are to ensure that the President
can undertake his constitutionally designated functions
effectively, free from undue pressures or distortions. 520
U. S., at 694, and n. 19 (quoting Fitzgerald, 457
U. S., at 755). “[I]t [is] the nature of the function
performed, not the identity of the actor who perform[s] it, that
inform[s] our immunity analysis.” Forrester v. White,
484 U.S.
219, 229 (1988). The separation of powers does not bar a
prosecution predicated on the President’s unofficial acts.[2]

															III

															Determining whether a former President is
entitled to immunity from a particular prosecution requires
applying the principles we have laid out to his conduct at issue.
The first step is to distinguish his official from unofficial
actions. In this case, however, no court has thus far considered
how to draw that distinction, in general or with respect to the
conduct alleged in particular.

															Despite the unprecedented nature of this case,
and the very significant constitutional questions that it raises,
the lower courts rendered their decisions on a highly expedited
basis. Because those courts categorically rejected any form
of Presidential immunity, they did not analyze the conduct alleged
in the indictment to decide which of it should be categorized as
official and which unofficial. Neither party has briefed that issue
before us (though they discussed it at oral argument in response to
questions). And like the underlying immunity question, that
categorization raises multiple unprecedented and momentous
questions about the powers of the President and the limits of his
authority under the Constitution. As we have noted, there is little
pertinent precedent on those subjects to guide our review of this
case—a case that we too are deciding on an expedited basis, less
than five months after we granted the Government’s request to
construe Trump’s emergency application for a stay as a petition for
certiorari, grant that petition, and answer the consequential
immunity question. See 601 U. S., at ___. Given all these
circumstances, it is particularly incumbent upon us to be mindful
of our frequent admonition that “[o]urs is a court of final review
and not first view.” Zivotofsky v. Clinton, 566 U.S.
189, 201 (2012) (internal quotation marks omitted).

															Critical threshold issues in this case are how
to differentiate between a President’s official and unofficial
actions, and how to do so with respect to the indictment’s
extensive and detailed allegations covering a broad range of
conduct. We offer guidance on those issues below. Certain
allegations—such as those involving Trump’s discussions with the
Acting Attorney General—are readily categorized in light of the
nature of the President’s official relationship to the office held
by that individual. Other allegations—such as those involving
Trump’s interactions with the Vice President, state officials, and
certain private parties, and his comments to the general
public—present more difficult questions. Although we identify
several considerations pertinent to classifying those allegations
and determining whether they are subject to immunity, that analysis
ultimately is best left to the lower courts to perform in the first
instance.

															A

															Distinguishing the President’s official
actions from his unofficial ones can be difficult. When the
President acts pursuant to “constitutional and statutory
authority,” he takes official action to perform the functions of
his office. Fitzgerald, 457 U. S., at 757. Determining
whether an action is covered by immunity thus begins with assessing
the President’s authority to take that action.

															But the breadth of the President’s
“discretionary responsibilities” under the Constitution and laws of
the United States “in a broad variety of areas, many of them highly
sensitive,” frequently makes it “difficult to determine which of
[his] innumerable ‘functions’ encompassed a particular action.”
Id., at 756. And some Presidential conduct—for example,
speaking to and on behalf of the American people, see Trump
v. Hawaii, 585 U.S. 667, 701 (2018)—certainly can qualify as
official even when not obviously connected to a particular
constitutional or statutory provision. For those reasons, the
immunity we have recognized extends to the “outer perimeter” of the
President’s official responsibilities, covering actions so long as
they are “not manifestly or palpably beyond [his] authority.”
Blassingame v. Trump, 87 F. 4th 1, 13 (CADC
2023) (internal quotation marks omitted); see Fitzgerald,
457 U. S., at 755–756 (noting that we have “refused to draw
functional lines finer than history and reason would support”).

															In dividing official from unofficial conduct,
courts may not inquire into the President’s motives. Such an
inquiry would risk exposing even the most obvious instances of
official conduct to judicial examination on the mere allegation of
improper purpose, thereby intruding on the Article II interests
that immunity seeks to protect. Indeed, “[i]t would seriously
cripple the proper and effective administration of public affairs
as entrusted to the executive branch of the government” if “[i]n
exercising the functions of his office,” the President was “under
an apprehension that the motives that control his official conduct
may, at any time, become the subject of inquiry.”
Fitzgerald, 457 U. S., at 745 (quoting Spalding
v. Vilas, 161 U.S.
483, 498 (1896)). We thus rejected such inquiries in
Fitzgerald. The plaintiff there contended that he was
dismissed from the Air Force for retaliatory reasons. See 457
U. S., at 733–741, 756. The Air Force responded that the
reorganization that led to Fitzgerald’s dismissal was undertaken to
promote efficiency. Ibid. Because under Fitzgerald’s theory
“an inquiry into the President’s motives could not be avoided,” we
rejected the theory, observing that “[i]nquiries of this kind could
be highly intrusive.” Id., at 756. “[B]are allegations of
malice should not suffice to subject government officials either to
the costs of trial or to the burdens of broad-reaching discovery.”
Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S.
800, 817–818 (1982).

															Nor may courts deem an action unofficial merely
because it allegedly violates a generally applicable law. For
instance, when Fitzgerald contended that his dismissal violated
various congressional statutes and thus rendered his discharge
“outside the outer perimeter of [Nixon’s] duties,” we rejected that
contention. 457 U. S., at 756. Otherwise, Presidents
would be subject to trial on “every allegation that an action was
unlawful,” depriving immunity of its intended effect.
Ibid.

															B

															With these principles in mind, we turn to the
conduct alleged in the indictment.

															1

															The indictment broadly alleges that Trump and
his co-conspirators sought to “overturn the legitimate results of
the 2020 presidential election.” App. 183, Indictment ¶7. It
charges that they conspired to obstruct the January 6 congressional
proceeding at which electoral votes are counted and certified, and
the winner of the election is certified as President-elect.
Id., at 181–185, ¶¶4, 7, 9. As part of this conspiracy,
Trump and his co-conspirators allegedly attempted to leverage the
Justice Department’s power and authority to convince certain States
to replace their legitimate electors with Trump’s fraudulent slates
of electors. See id., at 215–220, ¶¶70–85. According to the
indictment, Trump met with the Acting Attorney General and other
senior Justice Department and White House officials to discuss
investigating purported election fraud and sending a letter from
the Department to those States regarding such fraud. See,
e.g., id., at 217, 219–220, ¶¶77, 84. The indictment
further alleges that after the Acting Attorney General resisted
Trump’s requests, Trump repeatedly threatened to replace him. See,
e.g., id., at 216–217, ¶¶74, 77.

															The Government does not dispute that the
indictment’s allegations regarding the Justice Department involve
Trump’s “use of official power.” Brief for United States 46; see
id., at 10–11; Tr. of Oral Arg. 125. The allegations in fact
plainly implicate Trump’s “conclusive and preclusive” authority.
“[I]nvestigation and prosecution of crimes is a quintessentially
executive function.” Brief for United States 19 (quoting
Morrison v. Olson, 487 U.S.
654, 706 (1988) (Scalia, J., dissenting)). And the Executive
Branch has “exclusive authority and absolute discretion” to decide
which crimes to investigate and prosecute, including with respect
to allegations of election crime. Nixon, 418 U. S., at
693; see United States v. Texas, 599 U.S. 670,
678–679 (2023) (“Under Article II, the Executive Branch possesses
authority to decide ‘how to prioritize and how aggressively to
pursue legal actions against defendants who violate the
law.’ ” (quoting TransUnion LLC v. Ramirez, 594
U.S. 413, 429 (2021))). The President may discuss potential
investigations and prosecutions with his Attorney General and other
Justice Department officials to carry out his constitutional duty
to “take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed.” Art. II,
§3. And the Attorney General, as head of the Justice Department,
acts as the President’s “chief law enforcement officer” who
“provides vital assistance to [him] in the performance of [his]
constitutional duty to ‘preserve, protect, and defend the
Constitution.’ ” Mitchell v. Forsyth, 472 U.S.
511, 520 (1985) (quoting Art. II, §1, cl. 8).

															Investigative and prosecutorial decisionmaking
is “the special province of the Executive Branch,” Heckler
v. Chaney, 470 U.S.
821, 832 (1985), and the Constitution vests the entirety of the
executive power in the President, Art. II, §1. For that reason,
Trump’s threatened removal of the Acting Attorney General likewise
implicates “conclusive and preclusive” Presidential authority. As
we have explained, the President’s power to remove “executive
officers of the United States whom he has appointed” may not be
regulated by Congress or reviewed by the courts. Myers, 272
U. S., at 106, 176; see supra, at 8. The President’s
“management of the Executive Branch” requires him to have
“unrestricted power to remove the most important of his
subordinates”—such as the Attorney General—“in their most important
duties.” Fitzgerald, 457 U. S., at 750 (internal
quotation marks and alteration omitted).

															The indictment’s allegations that the requested
investigations were “sham[s]” or proposed for an improper purpose
do not divest the President of exclusive authority over the
investigative and prosecutorial functions of the Justice Department
and its officials. App. 186–187, Indictment ¶10(c). And the
President cannot be prosecuted for conduct within his exclusive
constitutional authority. Trump is therefore absolutely immune from
prosecution for the alleged conduct involving his discussions with
Justice Department officials.

															2

															The indictment next alleges that Trump and his
co-conspirators “attempted to enlist the Vice President to use his
ceremonial role at the January 6 certification proceeding to
fraudulently alter the election results.” Id., at 187,
¶10(d). In particular, the indictment alleges several conversations
in which Trump pressured the Vice President to reject States’
legitimate electoral votes or send them back to state legislatures
for review. See, e.g., id., at 222–224, 226, ¶¶90,
92–93, 97.

															The Government explained at oral argument that
although it “has not yet had to come to grips with how [it] would
analyze” Trump’s interactions with the Vice President, there is
“support” to characterize that conduct as official. Tr. of Oral
Arg. 128. Indeed, our constitutional system anticipates that the
President and Vice President will remain in close contact regarding
their official duties over the course of the President’s term in
office. These two officials are the only ones “elected by the
entire Nation.” Seila Law, 591 U. S., at 224; see Art.
II, §1. The Constitution provides that “the Vice President shall
become President” in the case of “the removal of the President from
office or of his death or resignation.” Amdt. 25, §1. It also
“empowers the Vice President, together with a majority of the
‘principal officers of the executive departments,’ to declare the
President ‘unable to discharge the powers and duties of his
office.’ ” Freytag v. Commissioner, 501 U.S.
868, 886–887 (1991) (quoting Amdt. 25, §4). And Article I of
course names the Vice President as President of the Senate and
gives him a tiebreaking vote. §3, cl. 4. It is thus important
for the President to discuss official matters with the Vice
President to ensure continuity within the Executive Branch and to
advance the President’s agenda in Congress and beyond.

															The Vice President may in practice also serve as
one of the President’s closest advisers. The Office of Legal
Counsel has explained that within the Executive Branch, the Vice
President’s “sole function [is] advising and assisting the
President.” Whether the Office of the Vice President Is an ‘Agency’
for Purposes of the Freedom of Information Act, 18 Op. OLC 10
(1994). Indeed, the “ Twelfth Amendment was brought about” to avoid
the “manifestly intolerable” situation that occurred “[d]uring the
John Adams administration,” when “we had a President and
Vice-President of different parties.” Ray v. Blair,
343 U.S.
214, 224, n. 11 (1952). The President and Vice President
together “are the senior officials of the Executive Branch of
government” and therefore “must formulate, explain, advocate, and
defend policies” of the President’s administration. Payment of
Expenses Associated With Travel by the President and Vice
President, 6 Op. OLC 214, 215 (1982).

															As the President’s second in command, the Vice
President has historically performed important functions “at the
will and as the representative of the President.” Participation of
the Vice President in the Affairs of the Executive Branch, 1 Supp.
Op. OLC 214, 220 (1961). President Woodrow Wilson’s Vice President,
for instance, “presided over a few cabinet meetings while Wilson
was in France negotiating” the Treaty of Versailles after World War
I. H. Relyea, The Law: The Executive Office of the Vice President:
Constitutional and Legal Considerations, 40 Presidential Studies Q.
327, 328 (2010). During President Franklin Roosevelt’s
administration, the Vice President “became a regular participant in
cabinet deliberations—a practice that was continued by each
succeeding president.” Ibid. And when President Dwight
Eisenhower “suffered three major illnesses while in office
. . . Vice President Richard Nixon consulted with the
Cabinet and developed a procedure for relaying important matters to
the President.” Presidential Succession and Delegation in Case of
Disability, 5 Op. OLC 91, 102 (1981). At the President’s
discretion, “the Vice President may engage in activities ranging
into the highest levels of diplomacy and negotiation and may do so
anywhere in the world.” 1 Supp. Op. OLC, at 220. Domestically, he
may act as the President’s delegate to perform any duties
“co-extensive with the scope of the President’s power of
delegation.” Ibid.

															Whenever the President and Vice President
discuss their official responsibilities, they engage in official
conduct. Presiding over the January 6 certification proceeding at
which Members of Congress count the electoral votes is a
constitutional and statutory duty of the Vice President.
Art. II, §1, cl. 3; Amdt. 12; 3 U. S. C. §15.
The indictment’s allegations that Trump attempted to pressure the
Vice President to take particular acts in connection with his role
at the certification proceeding thus involve official conduct, and
Trump is at least presumptively immune from prosecution for such
conduct.

															The question then becomes whether that
presumption of immunity is rebutted under the circumstances. When
the Vice President presides over the January 6 certification
proceeding, he does so in his capacity as President of the Senate.
Ibid. Despite the Vice President’s expansive role of
advising and assisting the President within the Executive Branch,
the Vice President’s Article I responsibility of “presiding over
the Senate” is “not an ‘executive branch’ function.” Memorandum
from L. Silberman, Deputy Atty. Gen., to R. Burress, Office of the
President, Re: Conflict of Interest Problems Arising Out of the
President’s Nomination of Nelson A. Rockefeller To Be Vice
President Under the Twenty-Fifth Amendment to the Constitution 2
(Aug. 28, 1974). With respect to the certification proceeding in
particular, Congress has legislated extensively to define the Vice
President’s role in the counting of the electoral votes, see,
e.g., 3 U. S. C. §15, and the President plays no
direct constitutional or statutory role in that process. So the
Government may argue that consideration of the President’s
communications with the Vice President concerning the certification
proceeding does not pose “dangers of intrusion on the authority and
functions of the Executive Branch.” Fitzgerald, 457
U. S., at 754; see supra, at 14.

															At the same time, however, the President may
frequently rely on the Vice President in his capacity as President
of the Senate to advance the President’s agenda in Congress. When
the Senate is closely divided, for instance, the Vice President’s
tiebreaking vote may be crucial for confirming the President’s
nominees and passing laws that align with the President’s policies.
Applying a criminal prohibition to the President’s conversations
discussing such matters with the Vice President—even though they
concern his role as President of the Senate—may well hinder the
President’s ability to perform his constitutional functions.

															It is ultimately the Government’s burden to
rebut the presumption of immunity. We therefore remand to the
District Court to assess in the first instance, with appropriate
input from the parties, whether a prosecution involving Trump’s
alleged attempts to influence the Vice President’s oversight of the
certification proceeding in his capacity as President of the Senate
would pose any dangers of intrusion on the authority and functions
of the Executive Branch.

															3

															The indictment’s remaining allegations cover a
broad range of conduct. Unlike the allegations describing Trump’s
communications with the Justice Department and the Vice President,
these remaining allegations involve Trump’s interactions with
persons outside the Executive Branch: state officials, private
parties, and the general public. Many of the remaining allegations,
for instance, cover at great length events arising out of
communications that Trump and his co-conspirators initiated with
state legislators and election officials in Arizona, Georgia,
Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin regarding those States’
certification of electors. See App. 192–207, Indictment
¶¶13–52.

															Specifically, the indictment alleges that Trump
and his co-conspirators attempted to convince those officials that
election fraud had tainted the popular vote count in their States,
and thus electoral votes for Trump’s opponent needed to be changed
to electoral votes for Trump. See id., at 185–186, ¶10(a).
After Trump failed to convince those officials to alter their state
processes, he and his co-conspirators allegedly developed a plan
“to marshal individuals who would have served as [Trump’s]
electors, had he won the popular vote” in Arizona, Georgia,
Michigan, Nevada, New Mexico, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, “and
cause those individuals to make and send to the Vice President and
Congress false certifications that they were legitimate electors.”
Id., at 208, ¶53. If the plan worked, “the submission of
these fraudulent slates” would position the Vice President to “open
and count the fraudulent votes” at the certification proceeding and
set up “a fake controversy that would derail the proper
certification of Biden as president-elect.” Id., at 208–209,
¶¶53, 54(b). According to the indictment, Trump used his campaign
staff to effectuate the plan. See, e.g., id., at 210,
212–213, ¶¶55, 63. On the same day that the legitimate electors met
in their respective jurisdictions to cast their votes, the
indictment alleges that Trump’s “fraudulent electors convened sham
proceedings in the seven targeted states to cast fraudulent
electoral ballots” in his favor. Id., at 214, ¶66. Those
ballots “were mailed to the President of the Senate, the Archivist
of the United States, and others.” Ibid., ¶67.

															At oral argument, Trump appeared to concede that
at least some of these acts—those involving “private actors” who
“helped implement a plan to submit fraudulent slates of
presidential electors to obstruct the certification proceeding” at
the direction of Trump and a co-conspirator—entail “private”
conduct. Tr. of Oral Arg. 29–30. He later asserted, however, that
asking “the chairwoman of the Republican National Committee
. . . to gather electors” qualifies as official conduct
because “the organization of alternate slates of electors is based
on, for example, the historical example of President Grant as
something that was done pursuant to and ancillary and preparatory
to the exercise of ” a core Presidential power. Id., at
37; see also id., at 25 (discussing the “historical
precedent . . . of President Grant sending federal troops
to Louisiana and Mississippi in 1876 to make sure that the
Republican electors got certified in those two cases, which
delivered the election to Rutherford B. Hayes”). He also argued
that it is “[a]bsolutely an official act for the president to
communicate with state officials on . . . the integrity
of a federal election.” Id., at 38. The Government
disagreed, contending that this alleged conduct does not qualify as
“official conduct” but as “campaign conduct.” Id., at
124–125.

															On Trump’s view, the alleged conduct qualifies
as official because it was undertaken to ensure the integrity and
proper administration of the federal election. Of course, the
President’s duty to “take Care that the Laws be faithfully
executed” plainly encompasses enforcement of federal election laws
passed by Congress. Art. II, §3. And the President’s broad
power to speak on matters of public concern does not exclude his
public communications regarding the fairness and integrity of
federal elections simply because he is running for re-election. Cf.
Hawaii, 585 U. S., at 701. Similarly, the President may
speak on and discuss such matters with state officials—even when no
specific federal responsibility requires his communication—to
encourage them to act in a manner that promotes the President’s
view of the public good.

															As the Government sees it, however, these
allegations encompass nothing more than Trump’s “private scheme
with private actors.” Brief for United States 44. In its view,
Trump can point to no plausible source of authority enabling the
President to not only organize alternate slates of electors but
also cause those electors—unapproved by any state official—to
transmit votes to the President of the Senate for counting at the
certification proceeding, thus interfering with the votes of
States’ properly appointed electors. Indeed, the Constitution
commits to the States the power to “appoint” Presidential electors
“in such Manner as the Legislature thereof may direct.”
Art. II, §1, cl. 2; see Burroughs v. United
States, 290 U.S.
534, 544 (1934). “Article II, §1’s appointments power,” we have
said, “gives the States far-reaching authority over presidential
electors, absent some other constitutional constraint.”
Chiafalo v. Washington, 591 U.S. 578, 588–589 (2020).
By contrast, the Federal Government’s role in appointing electors
is limited. Congress may prescribe when the state-appointed
electors shall meet, and it counts and certifies their votes. Art.
II, §1, cls. 3, 4. The President, meanwhile, plays no direct role
in the process, nor does he have authority to control the state
officials who do. And the Framers, wary of “cabal, intrigue and
corruption,” specifically excluded from service as electors “all
those who from situation might be suspected of too great devotion
to the president in office.” The Federalist No. 68, at 459 (A.
Hamilton); see Art. II, §1, cl. 2.

															Determining whose characterization may be
correct, and with respect to which conduct, requires a close
analysis of the indictment’s extensive and interrelated
allegations. See App. 192–215, Indictment ¶¶13–69. Unlike Trump’s
alleged interactions with the Justice Department, this alleged
conduct cannot be neatly categorized as falling within a particular
Presidential function. The necessary analysis is instead fact
specific, requiring assessment of numerous alleged interactions
with a wide variety of state officials and private persons. And the
parties’ brief comments at oral argument indicate that they starkly
disagree on the characterization of these allegations. The concerns
we noted at the outset—the expedition of this case, the lack of
factual analysis by the lower courts, and the absence of pertinent
briefing by the parties—thus become more prominent. We accordingly
remand to the District Court to determine in the first
instance—with the benefit of briefing we lack—whether Trump’s
conduct in this area qualifies as official or unofficial.

															4

															Finally, the indictment contains various
allegations regarding Trump’s conduct in connection with the events
of January 6 itself. It alleges that leading up to the January 6
certification proceeding, Trump issued a series of Tweets (to his
nearly 89 million followers) encouraging his supporters to travel
to Washington, D. C., on that day. See, e.g., App. 221,
225–227, Indictment ¶¶87–88, 96, 100. Trump and his co-conspirators
addressed the gathered public that morning, asserting that certain
States wanted to recertify their electoral votes and that the Vice
President had the power to send those States’ ballots back for
recertification. Id., at 228–230, ¶¶103–104. Trump then
allegedly “directed the crowd in front of him to go to the Capitol”
to pressure the Vice President to do so at the certification
proceeding. Id., at 228–230, ¶104. When it became public
that the Vice President would not use his role at the certification
proceeding to determine which electoral votes should be counted,
the crowd gathered at the Capitol “broke through barriers cordoning
off the Capitol grounds” and eventually “broke into the building.”
Id., at 230–231, ¶¶107, 109.

															The alleged conduct largely consists of Trump’s
communications in the form of Tweets and a public address. The
President possesses “extraordinary power to speak to his fellow
citizens and on their behalf.” Hawaii, 585 U. S., at
701; cf. Lindke v. Freed, 601 U.S. 187, 191 (2024).
As the sole person charged by the Constitution with executing the
laws of the United States, the President oversees—and thus will
frequently speak publicly about—a vast array of activities that
touch on nearly every aspect of American life. Indeed, a
long-recognized aspect of Presidential power is using the office’s
“bully pulpit” to persuade Americans, including by speaking
forcefully or critically, in ways that the President believes would
advance the public interest. He is even expected to comment on
those matters of public concern that may not directly implicate the
activities of the Federal Government—for instance, to comfort the
Nation in the wake of an emergency or tragedy. For these reasons,
most of a President’s public communications are likely to fall
comfortably within the outer perimeter of his official
responsibilities.

															There may, however, be contexts in which the
President, notwithstanding the prominence of his position, speaks
in an unofficial capacity—perhaps as a candidate for office or
party leader. To the extent that may be the case, objective
analysis of “content, form, and context” will necessarily inform
the inquiry. Snyder v. Phelps, 562 U.S.
443, 453 (2011) (internal quotation marks omitted). But “there
is not always a clear line between [the President’s] personal and
official affairs.” Mazars, 591 U. S., at 868. The
analysis therefore must be fact specific and may prove to be
challenging.

															The indictment reflects these challenges. It
includes only select Tweets and brief snippets of the speech Trump
delivered on the morning of January 6, omitting its full text or
context. See App. 228–230, Indictment ¶104. Whether the Tweets,
that speech, and Trump’s other communications on January 6 involve
official conduct may depend on the content and context of each.
Knowing, for instance, what else was said contemporaneous to the
excerpted communications, or who was involved in transmitting the
electronic communications and in organizing the rally, could be
relevant to the classification of each communication. This
necessarily factbound analysis is best performed initially by the
District Court. We therefore remand to the District Court to
determine in the first instance whether this alleged conduct is
official or unofficial.

															C

															The essence of immunity “is its possessor’s
entitlement not to have to answer for his conduct” in court.
Mitchell, 472 U. S., at 525. Presidents therefore
cannot be indicted based on conduct for which they are immune from
prosecution. As we have explained, the indictment here alleges at
least some such conduct. See Part III–B–1, supra. On remand,
the District Court must carefully analyze the indictment’s
remaining allegations to determine whether they too involve conduct
for which a President must be immune from prosecution. And the
parties and the District Court must ensure that sufficient
allegations support the indictment’s charges without such
conduct.

															The Government does not dispute that if Trump is
entitled to immunity for certain official acts, he may not “be held
criminally liable” based on those acts. Brief for United States 46.
But it nevertheless contends that a jury could “consider” evidence
concerning the President’s official acts “for limited and specified
purposes,” and that such evidence would “be admissible to prove,
for example, [Trump’s] knowledge or notice of the falsity of his
election-fraud claims.” Id., at 46, 48. That proposal
threatens to eviscerate the immunity we have recognized. It would
permit a prosecutor to do indirectly what he cannot do
directly—invite the jury to examine acts for which a President is
immune from prosecution to nonetheless prove his liability on any
charge. But “[t]he Constitution deals with substance, not shadows.”
Cummings v. Missouri, 4 Wall. 277, 325 (1867). And
the Government’s position is untenable in light of the separation
of powers principles we have outlined.

															If official conduct for which the President is
immune may be scrutinized to help secure his conviction, even on
charges that purport to be based only on his unofficial conduct,
the “intended effect” of immunity would be defeated.
Fitzgerald, 457 U. S., at 756. The President’s immune
conduct would be subject to examination by a jury on the basis of
generally applicable criminal laws. Use of evidence about such
conduct, even when an indictment alleges only unofficial conduct,
would thereby heighten the prospect that the President’s official
decisionmaking will be distorted. See Clinton, 520
U. S., at 694, n. 19.

															The Government asserts that these weighty
concerns can be managed by the District Court through the use of
“evidentiary rulings” and “jury instructions.” Brief for United
States 46. But such tools are unlikely to protect adequately the
President’s constitutional prerogatives. Presidential acts
frequently deal with “matters likely to ‘arouse the most intense
feelings.’  ” Fitzgerald, 457 U. S., at 752
(quoting Pierson, 386 U. S., at 554). Allowing
prosecutors to ask or suggest that the jury probe official acts for
which the President is immune would thus raise a unique risk that
the jurors’ deliberations will be prejudiced by their views of the
President’s policies and performance while in office. The prosaic
tools on which the Government would have courts rely are an
inadequate safeguard against the peculiar constitutional concerns
implicated in the prosecution of a former President. Cf.
Nixon, 418 U. S., at 706. Although such tools may
suffice to protect the constitutional rights of individual criminal
defendants, the interests that underlie Presidential immunity seek
to protect not the President himself, but the institution of the
Presidency.[3]

															IV

															A

															Trump asserts a far broader immunity than the
limited one we have recognized. He contends that the indictment
must be dismissed because the Impeachment Judgment Clause requires
that impeachment and Senate conviction precede a President’s
criminal prosecution. Brief for Petitioner 16.

															The text of the Clause provides little support
for such an absolute immunity. It states that an impeachment
judgment “shall not extend further than to removal from Office, and
disqualification to hold and enjoy any Office of honor, Trust or
Profit under the United States.” Art. I, §3, cl. 7. It then
specifies that “the Party convicted shall nevertheless be
liable and subject to Indictment, Trial, Judgment and Punishment,
according to Law.” Ibid. (emphasis added). The Clause both
limits the consequences of an impeachment judgment and clarifies
that notwithstanding such judgment, subsequent prosecution may
proceed. By its own terms, the Clause does not address whether and
on what conduct a President may be prosecuted if he was never
impeached and convicted.

															Historical evidence likewise lends little
support to Trump’s position. For example, Justice Story reasoned
that without the Clause’s clarification that “Indictment, Trial,
Judgment and Punishment” may nevertheless follow Senate conviction,
“it might be matter of extreme doubt, whether . . . a
second trial for the same offence could be had, either after an
acquittal, or a conviction in the court of impeachments.” 2 J.
Story, Commentaries on the Constitution of the United States §780,
p. 251 (1833). James Wilson, who served on the Committee that
drafted the Clause and later as a Justice of this Court, similarly
concluded that acquittal of impeachment charges posed no bar to
subsequent prosecution. See 2 Documentary History of the
Ratification of the Constitution 492 (M. Jensen ed. 1979). And
contrary to Trump’s contention, Alexander Hamilton did not
disagree. The Federalist Papers on which Trump relies, see Brief
for Petitioner 17–18, concerned the checks available against a
sitting President. Hamilton noted that unlike “the King of
Great-Britain,” the President “would be liable to be impeached” and
“removed from office,” and “would afterwards be liable to
prosecution and punishment.” The Federalist No. 69, at 463; see
also id., No. 77, at 520 (explaining that the President is
“at all times liable to impeachment, trial, dismission from office
. . . and to the forfeiture of life and estate by
subsequent prosecution”). Hamilton did not endorse or even consider
whether the Impeachment Judgment Clause immunizes a former
President from prosecution.

															The implication of Trump’s theory is that a
President who evades impeachment for one reason or another during
his term in office can never be held accountable for his criminal
acts in the ordinary course of law. So if a President manages to
conceal certain crimes throughout his Presidency, or if Congress is
unable to muster the political will to impeach the President for
his crimes, then they must forever remain impervious to
prosecution.

															Impeachment is a political process by which
Congress can remove a President who has committed “Treason,
Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors.” Art. II, §4.
Transforming that political process into a necessary step in the
enforcement of criminal law finds little support in the text of the
Constitution or the structure of our Government.

															B

															The Government for its part takes a similarly
broad view, contending that the President enjoys no immunity from
criminal prosecution for any action. It maintains this view despite
agreeing with much of our analysis.

															For instance, the Government does not dispute
that Congress may not criminalize Presidential conduct within the
President’s “conclusive and preclusive” constitutional authority.
See Tr. of Oral Arg. 133 (“[C]ore powers . . . can’t be
regulated at all, like the pardon power and veto.”); see also
id., at 84–85. And it too accords protection to Presidential
conduct if subjecting that conduct to generally applicable laws
would “raise serious constitutional questions regarding the
President’s authority” or cause a “possible conflict with the
President’s constitutional prerogatives.” Application of 28
U. S. C. §458 to Presidential Appointments of Federal
Judges, 19 Op. OLC 350, 351–352 (1995); see Brief for United States
26–29; Tr. of Oral Arg. 78. Indeed, the Executive Branch has long
held that view. The Office of Legal Counsel has recognized, for
instance, that a federal statute generally prohibiting appointments
to “ ‘any office or duty in any court’ ” of persons
within certain degrees of consanguinity to the judges of such
courts would, if applied to the President, infringe his power to
appoint federal judges, thereby raising a serious constitutional
question. 19 Op. OLC, at 350 (quoting 28 U. S. C. §458);
see id., at 350–352. So it viewed such a statute as not
applying to the President. Likewise, it has narrowly construed a
criminal prohibition on grassroots lobbying to avoid the
constitutional issues that would otherwise arise, reasoning that
the statute should not “be construed to prohibit the President or
executive branch agencies from engaging in a general open dialogue
with the public on the Administration’s programs and policies.”
Constraints Imposed by 18 U. S. C. §1913 on Lobbying
Efforts, 13 Op. OLC 300, 304 (1989); see id., at
304–306.

															The Government thus broadly agrees that the
President’s official acts are entitled to some degree of
constitutional protection. And with respect to the allegations in
the indictment before us, the Government agrees that at least some
of the alleged conduct involves official acts. See Tr. of Oral Arg.
125; cf. id., at 128.

															Yet the Government contends that the President
should not be considered immune from prosecution for those official
acts. See Brief for United States 9. On the Government’s view,
as-applied challenges in the course of the trial suffice to protect
Article II interests, and review of a district court’s decisions on
such challenges should be deferred until after trial. See Tr. of
Oral Arg. 69, 79–80, 154–158. If the President is instead immune
from prosecution, a district court’s denial of immunity would be
appealable before trial. See Mitchell, 472 U. S., at
524–530 (explaining that questions of immunity are reviewable
before trial because the essence of immunity is the entitlement not
to be subject to suit).

															The Government asserts that the “[r]obust
safeguards” available in typical criminal proceedings alleviate the
need for pretrial review. Brief for United States 20 (boldface and
emphasis omitted). First, it points to the Justice Department’s
“longstanding commitment to the impartial enforcement of the law,”
id., at 21, as well as the criminal justice system’s further
protections: grand juries, a defendant’s procedural rights during
trial, and the requirement that the Government prove its case
beyond a reasonable doubt, id., at 22. Next, it contends
that “existing principles of statutory construction and as-applied
constitutional challenges” adequately address the separation of
powers concerns involved in applying generally applicable criminal
laws to a President. Id., at 29. Finally, the Government
cites certain defenses that would be available to the President in
a particular prosecution, such as the public-authority defense or
the advice of the Attorney General. Id., at 29–30; see
Nardone v. United States, 302
U.S. 379, 384 (1937); Tr. of Oral Arg. 107–108.

															These safeguards, though important, do not
alleviate the need for pretrial review. They fail to address the
fact that under our system of separated powers, criminal
prohibitions cannot apply to certain Presidential conduct to begin
with. As we have explained, when the President acts pursuant to his
exclusive constitutional powers, Congress cannot—as a structural
matter—regulate such actions, and courts cannot review them. See
Part II–A, supra. And he is at least presumptively immune
from prosecution for his other official actions. See Part II–B,
supra.

															Questions about whether the President may be
held liable for particular actions, consistent with the separation
of powers, must be addressed at the outset of a proceeding. Even if
the President were ultimately not found liable for certain official
actions, the possibility of an extended proceeding alone may render
him “unduly cautious in the discharge of his official duties.”
Fitzgerald, 457 U. S., at 752, n. 32.
Vulnerability “ ‘to the burden of a trial and to the
inevitable danger of its outcome, would dampen the ardor of all but
the most resolute.’ ” Id., at 752–753, n. 32
(quoting Gregoire v. Biddle, 177 F.2d 579, 581 (CA2
1949) (Hand, L., C. J.)). The Constitution does not tolerate
such impediments to “the effective functioning of government.”
Fitzgerald, 457 U. S., at 751.

															As for the Government’s assurances that
prosecutors and grand juries will not permit political or baseless
prosecutions from advancing in the first place, those assurances
are available to every criminal defendant and fail to account for
the President’s “unique position in the constitutional scheme.”
Id., at 749. We do not ordinarily decline to decide
significant constitutional questions based on the Government’s
promises of good faith. See United States v. Stevens,
559 U.S.
460, 480 (2010) (“We would not uphold an unconstitutional
statute merely because the Government promised to use it
responsibly.”). Nor do we do so today.

															C

															As for the dissents, they strike a tone of
chilling doom that is wholly disproportionate to what the Court
actually does today—conclude that immunity extends to official
discussions between the President and his Attorney General, and
then remand to the lower courts to determine “in the first
instance” whether and to what extent Trump’s remaining alleged
conduct is entitled to immunity. Supra, at 24, 28, 30.

															The principal dissent’s starting premise—that
unlike Speech and Debate Clause immunity, no constitutional text
supports Presidential immunity, see post, at 4–6 (opinion of
Sotomayor, J.)—is one that the Court rejected decades ago as
“unpersuasive.” Fitzgerald, 457 U. S., at 750,
n. 31; see also Nixon, 418 U. S., at 705–706,
n. 16 (rejecting unanimously a similar argument in the
analogous executive privilege context). “[A] specific textual basis
has not been considered a prerequisite to the recognition of
immunity.” Fitzgerald, 457 U. S., at 750, n. 31.
Nor is that premise correct. True, there is no “Presidential
immunity clause” in the Constitution. But there is no
“ ‘separation of powers clause’ ” either. Seila
Law, 591 U. S., at 227. Yet that doctrine is undoubtedly
carved into the Constitution’s text by its three articles
separating powers and vesting the Executive power solely in the
President. See ibid. And the Court’s prior decisions, such
as Nixon and Fitzgerald, have long recognized that
doctrine as mandating certain Presidential privileges and
immunities, even though the Constitution contains no explicit
“provision for immunity.” Post, at 4; see Part II–B–1,
supra. Neither the dissents nor the Government disavow any
of those prior decisions. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 76–77.

															The principal dissent then cites the Impeachment
Judgment Clause, arguing that it “clearly contemplates that a
former President may be subject to criminal prosecution.”
Post, at 6. But that Clause does not indicate whether a
former President may, consistent with the separation of powers, be
prosecuted for his official conduct in particular. See
supra, at 32–33. And the assortment of historical sources
the principal dissent cites are unhelpful for the same reason. See
post, at 6–8. As the Court has previously noted, relevant
historical evidence on the question of Presidential immunity is of
a “fragmentary character.” Fitzgerald, 457 U. S., at
752, n. 31; see also Clinton, 520 U. S., at
696–697; cf. Youngstown, 343 U. S., at 634 (Jackson,
J., concurring) (noting “the poverty of really useful and
unambiguous authority applicable to concrete problems of executive
power”). “[T]he most compelling arguments,” therefore, “arise from
the Constitution’s separation of powers and the Judiciary’s
historic understanding of that doctrine.” Fitzgerald, 457
U. S., at 752, n. 31.

															The Court’s prior admonition is evident in the
principal dissent’s citations. Some of its cherry-picked sources do
not even discuss the President in particular. See, e.g.,
post, at 7–8 (citing 2 Debates on the Constitution 177 (J.
Elliot ed. 1836); 2 J. Story, Commentaries on the Constitution of
the United States §780, pp. 250–251 (1833)). And none of them
indicate whether he may be prosecuted for his official conduct.
See, e.g., post, at 6, 7, n. 2 (citing The
Federalist No. 69; 4 Debates on the Constitution, at 109). The
principal dissent’s most compelling piece of evidence consists of
excerpted statements of Charles Pinckney from an 1800 Senate
debate. See post, at 7. But those statements reflect only
the now-discredited argument that any immunity not expressly
mentioned in the Constitution must not exist. See 3 Records of the
Federal Convention of 1787, pp. 384–385 (M. Farrand ed. 1911).
And Pinckney is not exactly a reliable authority on the separation
of powers: He went on to state on the same day that “it was wrong
to give the nomination of Judges to the President”—an opinion
expressly rejected by the Framers. Id., at 385. Given the
Framers’ desire for an energetic and vigorous President, the
principal dissent’s view that the Constitution they designed allows
all his actions to be subject to prosecution—even the exercise of
powers it grants exclusively to him—defies credulity.

															Unable to muster any meaningful textual or
historical support, the principal dissent suggests that there is an
“established understanding” that “former Presidents are answerable
to the criminal law for their official acts.” Post, at 9.
Conspicuously absent is mention of the fact that since the
founding, no President has ever faced criminal charges—let alone
for his conduct in office. And accordingly no court has ever been
faced with the question of a President’s immunity from prosecution.
All that our Nation’s practice establishes on the subject is
silence.

															Coming up short on reasoning, the dissents
repeatedly level variations of the accusation that the Court has
rendered the President “above the law.” See, e.g.,
post, at 1, 3, 11, 12, 21, 30 (opinion of Sotomayor, J.);
post, at 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 19 (opinion of Jackson, J.). As
before, that “rhetorically chilling” contention is “wholly
unjustified.” Fitzgerald, 457 U. S., at 758,
n. 41. Like everyone else, the President is subject to
prosecution in his unofficial capacity. But unlike anyone else, the
President is a branch of government, and the Constitution vests in
him sweeping powers and duties. Accounting for that reality—and
ensuring that the President may exercise those powers forcefully,
as the Framers anticipated he would—does not place him above the
law; it preserves the basic structure of the Constitution from
which that law derives.

															The dissents’ positions in the end boil down to
ignoring the Constitution’s separation of powers and the Court’s
precedent and instead fear mongering on the basis of extreme
hypotheticals about a future where the President “feels empowered
to violate federal criminal law.” Post, at 18 (opinion of
Sotomayor, J.); see post, at 26, 29–30; post, at 8–9,
10, 12, 16, 20–21 (opinion of Jackson, J.). The dissents overlook
the more likely prospect of an Executive Branch that cannibalizes
itself, with each successive President free to prosecute his
predecessors, yet unable to boldly and fearlessly carry out his
duties for fear that he may be next. For instance, Section
371—which has been charged in this case—is a broadly worded
criminal statute that can cover “ ‘any conspiracy for the
purpose of impairing, obstructing or defeating the lawful function
of any department of Government.’ ” United States v.
Johnson, 383 U.S.
169, 172 (1966) (quoting Haas v. Henkel,
216 U.S.
462, 479 (1910)). Virtually every President is criticized for
insufficiently enforcing some aspect of federal law (such as drug,
gun, immigration, or environmental laws). An enterprising
prosecutor in a new administration may assert that a previous
President violated that broad statute. Without immunity, such types
of prosecutions of ex-Presidents could quickly become routine. The
enfeebling of the Presidency and our Government that would result
from such a cycle of factional strife is exactly what the Framers
intended to avoid. Ignoring those risks, the dissents are instead
content to leave the preservation of our system of separated powers
up to the good faith of prosecutors.

															Finally, the principal dissent finds it
“troubling” that the Court does not “designate any course of
conduct alleged in the indictment as private.” Post, at 27.
Despite the unprecedented nature of this case, the significant
constitutional questions that it raises, its expedited treatment in
the lower courts and in this Court, the lack of factual analysis in
the lower courts, and the lack of briefing on how to categorize the
conduct alleged, the principal dissent would go ahead and declare
all of it unofficial. The other dissent, meanwhile, analyzes the
case under comprehensive models and paradigms of its own concoction
and accuses the Court of providing “no meaningful guidance about
how to apply [the] new paradigm or how to categorize a President’s
conduct.” Post, at 13 (opinion of Jackson, J.). It would
have us exhaustively define every application of Presidential
immunity. See post, at 13–14. Our dissenting colleagues
exude an impressive infallibility. While their confidence may be
inspiring, the Court adheres to time-tested practices
instead—deciding what is required to dispose of this case and
remanding after “revers[ing] on a threshold question,”
Zivotofsky, 566 U. S., at 201, to obtain “guidance from
the litigants [and] the court below,” Vidal v.
Elster, 602 U.S. 286, 328 (2024) (Sotomayor, J., concurring
in judgment).

															V

															This case poses a question of lasting
significance: When may a former President be prosecuted for
official acts taken during his Presidency? Our Nation has never
before needed an answer. But in addressing that question today,
unlike the political branches and the public at large, we cannot
afford to fixate exclusively, or even primarily, on present
exigencies. In a case like this one, focusing on “transient
results” may have profound consequences for the separation of
powers and for the future of our Republic. Youngstown, 343
U. S., at 634 (Jackson, J., concurring). Our perspective must
be more farsighted, for “[t]he peculiar circumstances of the moment
may render a measure more or less wise, but cannot render it more
or less constitutional.” Chief Justice John Marshall, A Friend of
the Constitution No. V, Alexandria Gazette, July 5, 1819, in John
Marshall’s Defense of McCulloch v. Maryland 190–191 (G.
Gunther ed. 1969).

															Our first President had such a perspective. In
his Farewell Address, George Washington reminded the Nation that “a
Government of as much vigour as is consistent with the perfect
security of Liberty is indispensable.” 35 Writings of George
Washington 226 (J. Fitzpatrick ed. 1940). A government “too feeble
to withstand the enterprises of faction,” he warned, could lead to
the “frightful despotism” of “alternate domination of one faction
over another, sharpened by the spirit of revenge.” Id., at
226–227. And the way to avoid that cycle, he explained, was to
ensure that government powers remained “properly distributed and
adjusted.” Id., at 226.

															It is these enduring principles that guide our
decision in this case. The President enjoys no immunity for his
unofficial acts, and not everything the President does is official.
The President is not above the law. But Congress may not
criminalize the President’s conduct in carrying out the
responsibilities of the Executive Branch under the Constitution.
And the system of separated powers designed by the Framers has
always demanded an energetic, independent Executive. The President
therefore may not be prosecuted for exercising his core
constitutional powers, and he is entitled, at a minimum, to a
presumptive immunity from prosecution for all his official acts.
That immunity applies equally to all occupants of the Oval Office,
regardless of politics, policy, or party.

															The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the
D. C. Circuit is vacated, and the case is remanded for further
proceedings consistent with this opinion.

															It is so ordered.

Notes
1
 Trump contends that the
indictment stretches Section 1512(c)(2) “far beyond its natural
meaning.” Brief for Petitioner 39, n. 4. As we explained in
Fischer v. United States, Section 1512(c)(2) covers
acts that impair “the availability or integrity for use in an
official proceeding of records, documents, objects, or
. . . other things used in the proceeding.” 603
U. S. ___, ___ (2024) (slip op., at 16). If necessary, the
District Court should determine in the first instance whether the
Section 1512(c)(2) charges may proceed in light of our decision in
Fischer.
2
 Our decision in
Clinton permitted claims alleging unofficial acts to proceed
against the sitting President. See 520 U. S., at 684. In the
criminal context, however, the Justice Department “has long
recognized” that “the separation of powers precludes the criminal
prosecution of a sitting President.” Brief for United States 9
(citing A Sitting President’s Amenability to Indictment and
Criminal Prosecution, 24 Op. OLC 222 (2000); emphasis deleted); see
Tr. for Oral Arg. 78.

 Justice Barrett
disagrees, arguing that in a bribery prosecution, for instance,
excluding “any mention” of the official act associated with the
bribe “would hamstring the prosecution.” Post, at 6 (opinion
concurring in part); cf. post, at 25–27 (opinion of
Sotomayor, J.). But of course the prosecutor may point to the
public record to show the fact that the President performed the
official act. And the prosecutor may admit evidence of what the
President allegedly demanded, received, accepted, or agreed to
receive or accept in return for being influenced in the performance
of the act. See 18 U. S. C. §201(b)(2). What the
prosecutor may not do, however, is admit testimony or private
records of the President or his advisers probing the official act
itself. Allowing that sort of evidence would invite the jury to
inspect the President’s motivations for his official actions and to
second-guess their propriety. As we have explained, such inspection
would be “highly intrusive” and would “ ‘seriously
cripple’ ” the President’s exercise of his official duties.
Fitzgerald, 457 U. S., at 745, 756 (quoting
Spalding v. Vilas, 161 U.S.
483, 498 (1896)); see supra, at 18. And such
second-guessing would “threaten the independence or effectiveness
of the Executive.” Trump v. Vance, 591 U.S. 786, 805
(2020).
