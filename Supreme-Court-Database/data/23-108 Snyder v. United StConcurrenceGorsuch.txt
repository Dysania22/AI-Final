															SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

															_________________

															No. 23–108

															_________________

															JAMES E. SNYDER, PETITIONER v. UNITED
STATES

															on writ of certiorari to the united states
court of appeals for the seventh circuit

															[June 26, 2024]

															

															Justice Gorsuch, concurring.

															Call it what you will. The Court today speaks of
inferences from the word “corruptly,” the statute’s history and
structure, and associated punishments. See ante, at 7. It
discusses concerns of fair notice and federalism. Ibid. But
the bottom line is that, for all those reasons, any fair reader of
this statute would be left with a reasonable doubt about whether it
covers the defendant’s charged conduct. And when that happens,
judges are bound by the ancient rule of lenity to decide the case
as the Court does today, not for the prosecutor but for the
presumptively free individual. See United States v.
Davis, 588 U.S. 445, 464–465 (2019).

															Lenity may sometimes, as it does today, go
unnamed.  It may be deployed under other guises, too. “Fair
notice” or “fair warning” are especially familiar masks. See,
e.g., ante, at 7, 11, 13; Marinello v.
United States, 584 U.S. 1, 6–7, 9–10 (2018);
McDonnell v. United States, 579 U.S. 550, 576 (2016).
Cf. Wooden v. United States, 595 U.S. 360, 389 (2022)
(Gorsuch, J., concurring in judgment) (“Lenity works to enforce the
fair notice requirement”); Yates v. United States,
574 U.S.
528, 548 (2015) (plurality opinion) (same). Other times, we
clothe lenity in its corollary—that courts cannot “rely upon
prosecutorial discretion to narrow the” scope of an “otherwise
wide-ranging” criminal law. Marinello, 584 U. S., at
11; see, e.g., ante, at 13; Dubin v.
United States, 599 U.S. 110, 131 (2023). And in still other
instances, we do much the same when we speak of the “restraint”
necessary “in assessing the reach of a federal criminal statute.”
Id., at 129 (internal quotation marks omitted); accord,
Marinello, 584 U. S., at 6–7, 11; Arthur Andersen
LLP v. United States, 544 U.S.
696, 703 (2005).

															But make no mistake: Whatever the label, lenity
is what’s at work behind today’s decision, just as it is in so many
others. Rightly so. I am pleased to join.
