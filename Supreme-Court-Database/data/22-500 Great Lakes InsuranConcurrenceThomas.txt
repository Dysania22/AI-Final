															SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

															GREAT LAKES INSURANCE SE v. RAIDERS
RETREAT REALTY CO., LLC

															on writ of certiorari to the united states
court of appeals for the third circuit

															[February 21, 2024]

															Justice Thomas, concurring.

															I join the Court’s opinion in full because it
correctly concludes that federal maritime law governs the
enforceability of choice-of-law provisions in maritime contracts.
In arguing that state law should govern, Raiders Retreat Realty
relies principally on this Court’s decision in Wilburn Boat
Co. v. Fireman’s Fund Ins. Co., 348
U.S. 310 (1955). I write separately to highlight how Wilburn
Boat rests on flawed premises and, more broadly, how the
decision is at odds with the fundamental precept of admiralty law.
This Court has already retreated from Wilburn Boat’s unsound
holding, limiting it to local disputes. Litigants and courts
applying Wilburn Boat in the future should not ignore these
developments.

															The Constitution extends the judicial power to
“all Cases of admiralty and maritime Jurisdiction.” Art. III,
§2, cl. 1. We have long understood this grant of jurisdiction
to establish a uniform body of substantive law called the general
maritime law. See Knickerbocker Ice Co. v. Stewart,
253 U.S.
149, 160–161 (1920); The Lottawanna, 21 Wall. 558, 575
(1875). For almost 150 years before Wilburn Boat, it was
well established that marine-insurance disputes fell within that
admiralty jurisdiction. See Insurance Co. v. Dunham,
11 Wall. 1, 35 (1871); DeLovio v. Boit, 7 F. Cas.
418, 444 (No. 3,776) (CC Mass. 1815) (Story, J.). And, it was
widely accepted that courts applied general maritime law in such
disputes as a result. See Watts v. Camors, 115 U.S.
353, 362 (1885). Wilburn Boat upset this understanding
by inviting courts to apply state law in a broad range of
marine-insurance disputes. That break from settled practice was
unwarranted.

															Wilburn Boat involved an insurance claim
on a small houseboat that was destroyed by fire while moored in
Lake Texoma, an artificial inland lake. 348 U. S., at 311. The
houseboat’s owner conceded that he breached the marine-insurance
policy’s express warranty limiting his use to private pleasure by
carrying passengers for hire. Ibid. Even though that breach
was unrelated to the fire, the insurer declined coverage on
breach-of-warranty grounds, arguing that federal maritime law
requires literal compliance with express warranties and that any
breach thus releases the insurer from liability. See id., at
311–312. The owner countered that Texas law—not federal maritime
law—should determine the consequences of a breach of warranty, and
that breaching the private-pleasure warranty would not justify
denying coverage under Texas law. Id., at 312. To resolve
this choice-of-law dispute, the Court posed two questions:
“(1) Is there a judicially established federal admiralty rule
governing these warranties? (2) If not, should we fashion
one?” Id., at 314. Answering both questions in the negative,
this Court concluded that state law governs the effect of a breach
of warranty in a marine-insurance policy. Id., at 316,
320–321.

															Wilburn Boat’s rationale is deeply
flawed. The Court’s first conclusion, that there was no established
federal admiralty rule requiring literal compliance with express
warranties, is indefensible. See id., at 314–316. Treatises
from the early 19th century to the 20th century recognized the
literal compliance rule as part of the general maritime law
governing marine insurance. See, e.g., 2 R. Simey
& G. Mitchison, Arnould on the Law of Marine Insurance and
Average §635, p. 863 (12th ed. 1939); 2 T. Parsons, Maritime Law
104–105 (1859); 1 J. Park, A System of the Law of Marine Insurances
422 (6th ed. 1809); J. Burn, Law of Marine Insurances 80 (1801). By
the time of Wilburn Boat, at least five Courts of Appeals
had applied that rule in marine-insurance cases. See,
e.g., Home Ins. Co. v. Ciconett, 179
F.2d 892, 894 (CA6 1950); Robinson v. Home Ins. Co.,
73 F.2d 3, 4 (CA5 1934); Aetna Ins. Co. v. Houston Oil
& Transp. Co., 49 F.2d 121, 124 (CA5 1931); Fidelity-
Phenix Ins. Co. v. Chicago Title & Trust Co., 12
F.2d 573, 574 (CA7 1926); Shamrock Towing Co. v. American
Ins. Co., 9 F.2d 57, 60 (CA2 1925); Canton Ins. Office
v. Independent Transp. Co., 217 F. 213, 217 (CA9 1914). And,
as Justice Reed highlighted in dissent, “[n]o case h[eld] to the
contrary.” Wilburn Boat, 348 U. S., at 326.

															The Court’s only rejoinder was that some Court
of Appeals decisions may have drawn the literal compliance
rule from state or general common law, rather than general maritime
law. Id., at 315. Even so, the Court never explained why the
two decisions that identified general maritime law as the source of
the literal compliance rule were not enough to “establish” a
federal admiralty rule. See Home Ins. Co., 179 F. 2d,
at 894; Aetna Ins. Co., 49 F. 2d, at 124. Nor did it
grapple with the seemingly universal endorsement of the rule in
marine-insurance treatises. See Air & Liquid Systems
Corp. v. DeVries, 586 U.S. 446, 452 (2019) (“In
formulating federal maritime law, the federal courts may examine,
among other sources, judicial opinions, legislation, treatises, and
scholarly writings”). At any rate, that some decisions were not
explicit about the source of the literal compliance rule is
unsurprising given the common understanding that general maritime
law applied in admiralty cases. See Watts, 115 U. S.,
at 362. And, it is telling that many of those decisions rely on the
classic marine-insurance treatise, Arnould on Marine Insurance. See
Robinson, 73 F. 2d, at 4; Fidelity-Phenix, 12
F. 2d, at 574; Shamrock Towing, 9 F. 2d, at 60;
Canton, 217 F., at 217. In short, at the time of Wilburn
Boat, the existence of an established federal maritime rule
addressing the effect of a breach of warranty could not plausibly
be questioned.

															The Wilburn Boat Court’s justification
for not creating a federal admiralty rule is equally problematic.
It reasoned that general insurance regulation is an area that
historically has been left to the States and that courts are ill
suited for crafting marine insurance law on a case-by-case basis.
See 348 U. S., at 316–317, 319–320. The fact that States have
traditionally provided rules of decision for general
insurance law is no reason to leave marine insurance law to
them. States have traditionally provided rules of decision for
general contract and tort law, yet federal courts continue to
develop maritime law in those areas. See, e.g.,
Air & Liquid Systems Corp., 586 U. S., at 453–455;
Exxon Shipping Co. v. Baker, 554
U.S. 471, 506–507 (2008); Norfolk Southern R. Co.
v. James N. Kirby, Pty Ltd., 543 U.S.
14, 33 (2004); Bisso v. Inland Waterways Corp.,
349 U.S.
85, 90 (1955). The Wilburn Boat Court’s doubts about the
ability of judges to craft marine-insurance rules on a case-by-case
basis is simply a critique of the common-law process. But, federal
courts exercising admiralty jurisdiction act as common-law courts,
Air & Liquid Systems Corp., 586 U. S., at 452, and
the difficulties inherent in that role do not justify abandoning
it.

															A noticeable deficiency of Wilburn Boat
was its failure to even acknowledge the uniformity principle—a
singularly important concept in admiralty law. We have long
recognized that the Constitution’s grant of admiralty jurisdiction
“referred to a system of law coextensive with, and operating
uniformly in, the whole country,” and empowered federal courts to
maintain that national system using a common-law process. The
Lottawanna, 21 Wall., at 575. Only a uniform system of maritime
law, the Court has explained, can ensure the “consistency at which
the Constitution aimed on all subjects of a commercial character
affecting” interstate and foreign commerce. Ibid. This need
for uniformity has been the “touchstone” for determining the scope
of admiralty jurisdiction and the extent to which state law can be
given effect in admiralty cases. Kirby, 543 U. S., at
28; see also Kossick v. United Fruit Co., 365 U.S.
731, 741–742 (1961); Southern Pacific Co. v.
Jensen, 244 U.S.
205, 216 (1917); DeLovio, 7 F. Cas., at 443.
Notwithstanding this settled principle, however, Wilburn
Boat said nothing about uniformity. It did not so much as
consider whether a need for uniformity required a federal rule on
the effect of breaching an express warranty in a marine-insurance
contract. This silence is inexplicable given that both Justice
Frankfurter’s concurrence and Justice Reed’s dissent discussed
uniformity at length. See 348 U. S., at 322–324 (Frankfurter,
J., concurring in result); id., at 332–334 (Reed, J.,
dissenting). As Justice Reed lamented, “the Court’s decision
strikes deep into the principle of a uniform admiralty law,” and
worse, it did so without explaining why. Id., at 327.

															Unsurprisingly, Wilburn Boat has been met
with universal criticism over the past 70 years. A mere two years
after the decision, the Nation’s foremost admiralty scholars wrote
a stinging critique in their treatise. See G. Gilmore & C.
Black, The Law of Admiralty 44–45, 62–63 (1957). Wilburn
Boat’s rationale, they explained, suggests that state law
provides the rule of decision “when it happens that such cases have
not presented themselves to the federal courts in such number or
with the issues so posed as to result in decision of the point
involved.” Gilmore, Law of Admiralty, at 62 (emphasis deleted).
This, they concluded, is “a nightmarish solution” because “[s]ome
of the most important and obvious propositions in marine insurance
law are rarely litigated.” Id., at 62–63. One exhaustive
study of the opinion also concluded that Wilburn Boat “was
poorly reasoned and its holding poorly articulated.” J. Goldstein,
The Life and Times of Wilburn Boat: A Critical Guide (Part
I), 28 J. Mar. L. & Com. 395, 396 (1997). It explained that
Wilburn Boat did not “articulate any convincing theory of
the extent to which uniformity is a basic characteristic of
maritime law,” “showed little appreciation” for the Judiciary’s
role in fashioning the general maritime law, and “failed to produce
a decision or analysis that would provide guidance to the lower
courts.” J. Goldstein, The Life and Times of Wilburn Boat: A
Critical Guide (Part II), 28 J. Mar. L. & Com. 555, 591 (1997).
And, a modern treatise explains that “Wilburn Boat has
(1) produced a ‘crazy-quilt’ pattern of federal-state
regulation of marine insurance; and (2) bogged the courts down
in complex and confusing choice-of-law questions.” 2 T. Schoenbaum,
Admiralty and Maritime Law §19:9, p. 438 (6th ed. 2018).[1]*

															It is little wonder that this Court has
retreated from Wilburn Boat in subsequent decisions,
implicitly cabining its reach to “localized” disputes in accordance
with Justice Frankfurter’s concurrence. See 348 U. S., at 322.
In Kossick, for example, this Court held that general
maritime law, not a state statute of frauds, governed the validity
of a shipowner’s oral contract with a seaman. 365 U. S., at
732–733, 742. The Court attributed the decision in Wilburn
Boat in part to the inherently local nature of its dispute
about “a contract of insurance on a houseboat established in the
waters of a small artificial lake.” 365 U. S., at 742. Fifty
years later, we endorsed this narrow reading of Wilburn Boat
in Kirby, holding that general maritime law governed a
maritime contract for the carriage of goods primarily by sea. 543
U. S., at 18–19, 22–23. We explained that “[w]hen a contract
is a maritime one, and the dispute is not inherently local, federal
law controls the contract interpretation.” Id., at 22–23.
Today’s decision further erodes Wilburn Boat’s foundation,
and rightly so. See ante, at 7–9.

															In light of these decisions, it is not clear
what, if anything, is left of Wilburn Boat’s rationale. Yet,
Raiders and some courts continue to understand Wilburn Boat
to require application of state law in circumstances far different
from the inherently local dispute at issue there. See,
e.g., Travelers Property Casualty Co. of Am.
v. Ocean Reef Charters LLC, 996 F.3d 1161, 1169–1170 (CA11
2021); In re Settoon Towing, 720 F.3d 268, 282–284 (CA5
2013). But see Lloyd’s of London v. Págan-Sánchez,
539 F.3d 19, 24 (CA1 2008) (recognizing that Wilburn Boat
applies only to “inherently local” disputes (internal quotation
marks omitted)). Litigants and courts should heed our instruction
that general maritime law applies in maritime contract disputes
unless they “so implicate local interests as to beckon
interpretation by state law.” Kirby, 543 U. S., at 27.
Wilburn Boat reaches no further.
