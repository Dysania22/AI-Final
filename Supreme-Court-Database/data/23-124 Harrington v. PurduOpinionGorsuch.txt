															William K. Harrington, United States Trustee,
Region 2, PETITIONER v. Purdue Pharma L. P., et al.

															on writ of certiorari to the united states
court of appeals for the second circuit

															[June 27, 2024]

															

															Justice Gorsuch delivered the opinion of the
Court.

															The bankruptcy code contains hundreds of
interlocking rules about “ ‘the relations between’ ” a
“ ‘debtor and [its] creditors.’ ” Wright v.
Union Central Life Ins. Co., 304 U.S.
502, 513–514 (1938). But beneath that complexity lies a simple
bargain: A debtor can win a discharge of its debts if it proceeds
with honesty and places virtually all its assets on the table for
its creditors. The debtor in this case, Purdue Pharma L. P.,
filed for bankruptcy after facing a wave of litigation for its role
in the opioid epidemic. Purdue’s long-time owners, members of the
Sackler family, confronted a growing number of suits too. But
instead of declaring bankruptcy, they chose a different path. From
the court overseeing Purdue’s bankruptcy, they sought and won an
order extinguishing vast numbers of existing and potential claims
against them. They obtained all this without securing the consent
of those affected or placing anything approaching their total
assets on the table for their creditors. The question we face is
whether the bankruptcy code authorizes a court to issue an order
like that.

															I

															A

															The opioid epidemic represents “one of the
largest public health crises in this nation’s history.”
In re Purdue Pharma L. P., 69 F. 4th 45, 56
(CA2 2023). Between 1999 and 2019, approximately 247,000 people in
the United States died from prescription-opioid overdoses.
In re Purdue Pharma L. P., 635 B.R. 26, 44
(SDNY 2021). The U. S. Department of Health and Human Services
estimates that the opioid epidemic has cost the country between $53
and $72 billion annually. Ibid.

															Purdue sits at the center of these events. In
the mid-1990s, it began marketing OxyContin, an opioid prescription
pain reliever. 69 F. 4th, at 56. Because of the addictive
quality of opioids, doctors had traditionally reserved their use
for cancer patients and those “with chronic diseases.” 635
B. R., at 42. But OxyContin, Purdue claimed, had a novel
“time-release” formula that greatly diminished the threat of
addiction. Ibid. On that basis, Purdue marketed OxyContin
for use in “ ‘a much broader range’ ” of applications,
including as a “ ‘first-line therapy for the treatment of
arthritis.’ ” Ibid.

															Purdue was a “ ‘family company,’ ”
owned and controlled by the Sacklers. Id., at 40. Members of
the Sackler family served as president and chief executive officer;
they dominated the board of directors; and they “were heavily
involved” in the firm’s marketing strategies. 69 F. 4th, at 86
(Wesley, J., concurring in judgment). They “pushed sales
targets,” too, and “accompanied sales representatives on ‘ride
along’ visits to health care providers” in an effort to maximize
OxyContin sales. 635 B. R., at 50.

															Quickly, OxyContin became “ ‘the most
prescribed brand-name narcotic medication’ ” in the United
States. Id., at 43. Between 1996 and 2019, “Purdue generated
approximately $34 billion in revenue . . . , most of
which came from OxyContin sales.” Id., at 39. The company’s
success propelled the Sacklers onto lists “of the top twenty
wealthiest families in America,” with an estimated net worth of $14
billion. Id., at 40.

															Eventually, however, the firm came under
scrutiny. In 2007, a Purdue affiliate pleaded guilty to a federal
felony for misbranding OxyContin as “ ‘less addictive’ ”
and “ ‘less subject to abuse . . . than other pain
medications.’ ” Id., at 48. Thousands of civil lawsuits
followed as individuals, families, and governments within and
outside the United States sought damages from Purdue and the
Sacklers for injuries allegedly caused by their deceptive marketing
practices. 69 F. 4th, at 60.

															Appreciating this litigation “would eventually
impact them directly,” id., at 59, the Sacklers began what
one family member described as a “ ‘milking’ program,” 635
B. R., at 57. In the years before the 2007 plea agreement,
Purdue’s distributions to the Sacklers represented less than 15% of
its annual revenue. Ibid. After the plea agreement, the
Sacklers began taking as much as 70% of the company’s revenue each
year. Ibid. Between 2008 and 2016, the family’s
distributions totaled approximately $11 billion, draining Purdue’s
total assets by 75% and leaving it in “a significantly weakened
financial” state. 69 F. 4th, at 59. The Sacklers diverted much
of that money to overseas trusts and family-owned companies. 635
B. R., at 71.

															B

															In 2019, Purdue filed for Chapter 11
bankruptcy. Members of the Sackler family saw in that development
an opportunity “to get [their own] goals accomplished.” In re
Purdue Pharma L. P., No. 19–23649 (Bkrtcy. Ct.
SDNY, Aug. 18, 2021), ECF Doc. 3599, p. 35 (testimony of David
Sackler). They proposed to return to Purdue’s bankruptcy estate
$4.325 billion of the $11 billion they had withdrawn from the
company in recent years. 69 F. 4th, at 61. But they offered to
do so only through payments spread out over a decade. Id.,
at 60. And, in return, they sought the estate’s agreement on, and a
judicial order addressing, two matters. First, the Sacklers wanted
to extinguish any claims the estate might have against family
members, including for fraudulently transferring funds from Purdue
in the years preceding its bankruptcy. In re Purdue Pharma
L. P., 633 B.R. 53, 83–84 (Bkrtcy. Ct. SDNY 2021).
Second, the Sacklers wanted to end the growing number of lawsuits
against them brought by opioid victims (the Sackler discharge).
Ibid.

															The Sackler discharge they proposed comprised a
release and an injunction. The release sought to void not just
current opioid-related claims against the family, but future ones
as well. It sought to ban not just claims by creditors
participating in the bankruptcy proceeding, but claims by anyone
who might otherwise sue Purdue. It sought to extinguish not only
claims for negligence, but also claims for fraud and willful
misconduct. 1 App. 193. And it proposed to end all these lawsuits
without the consent of the opioid victims who brought them. To
enforce this release, the Sacklers sought an injunction “forever
stay[ing], restrain[ing,] and enjoin[ing]” claims against them.
Id., at 279. That injunction would not just prevent suits
against the company’s officers and directors but would run in favor
of hundreds, if not thousands, of Sackler family members and
entities under their control. Id., at 117–190.

															Purdue agreed to these terms and included them
in the reorganization plan it presented to the bankruptcy court for
approval. In that plan, Purdue further proposed to reorganize as a
“public benefit” company dedicated primarily to opioid education
and abatement efforts. 633 B. R., at 74. As for individual
victims harmed by the company’s products, Purdue offered, with help
from the Sacklers’ anticipated contribution, to provide payments
from a base amount of $3,500 up to a ceiling of $48,000 (for the
most dire cases, and all before deductions for attorney’s fees and
other expenses). See 1 App. 557–559, 573–585; 6 App. in No. 22–110
etc. (CA2), p. 1697. For those receiving more than the base
amount, payments would come in installments spread over as many as
10 years. 7 id., at 1805, 1812.

															Creditors were polled on the proposed plan.
Though most who returned ballots supported it, fewer than 20% of
eligible creditors participated. 21 id., at 6253, 6258.
Thousands of opioid victims voted against the plan too, and many
pleaded with the bankruptcy court not to wipe out their claims
against the Sacklers without their consent. 635 B. R., at 35.
“Our system of justice,” they wrote, “demands that the allegations
against the Sackler family be fully and fairly litigated in a
public and open trial, that they be judged by an impartial jury,
and that they be held accountable to those they have harmed.” In
re Purdue Pharma L. P., No. 7:21–cv–07532 (SDNY,
Oct. 25, 2021), ECF Doc. 94, p. 21 (internal quotation marks
omitted). The U. S. Trustee, charged with promoting the
integrity of the bankruptcy system for all stakeholders, joined in
these objections. So did eight States, the District of Columbia,
the city of Seattle, and various Canadian municipalities and
Tribes, each of which sought to pursue its own claims against the
Sacklers. 635 B. R., at 35.

															C

															The bankruptcy court rejected the objectors’
arguments and entered an order confirming the plan, including its
provisions related to the Sackler discharge. 633 B. R., at
95–115. Soon, however, the district court vacated that decision.
Nothing in the law, that court held, authorized the bankruptcy
court to extinguish claims against the Sacklers without the consent
of the opioid victims who brought them. 635 B. R., at 115.

															After that setback, plan proponents, including
Purdue, members of the Sackler family, and various creditors,
appealed to the Second Circuit. While their appeal was pending,
they also floated a new proposal. Now, they said, the Sacklers were
willing to contribute an additional $1.175 to $1.675 billion to
Purdue’s estate if the eight objecting States and the District of
Columbia would withdraw their objections to the firm’s
reorganization plan. 69 F. 4th, at 67. The Sacklers’ proposed
contribution still fell well short of the $11 billion they received
from the company between 2008 and 2016. Nor did it begin to reflect
the earnings the Sacklers have enjoyed from that sum over time. And
the proposed contribution would still come in installments spread
over many years. But the new proposal was enough to persuade the
States and the District of Columbia to drop their objections to the
plan, even as a number of individual victims, the Canadian
creditors, and the U. S. Trustee persisted in theirs.

															Ultimately, a divided panel of the Second
Circuit reversed the district court and revived the bankruptcy
court’s order approving the estate’s (now-modified) reorganization
plan. Writing separately, Judge Wesley acknowledged that a
bankruptcy court enjoys broad authority to modify debtor-creditor
relations. But, he argued, nothing in the bankruptcy code grants a
bankruptcy court the “extraordinary” power to release and enjoin
claims against a third party without the consent of the affected
claimants. Id., at 89 (opinion concurring in judgment). The
majority’s contrary view, he added, “pin[ned the Second] Circuit
firmly on one side of a weighty issue that, for too long, has split
the courts of appeals.” Id., at 90.

															After the Second Circuit ruled, the U. S.
Trustee filed an application with this Court to stay its decision.
We granted the application and, treating it as a petition for a
writ of certiorari, agreed to take this case to resolve the circuit
split Judge Wesley highlighted. 600 U. S. ___ (2023).[1]

															II

															The plan proponents and U. S. Trustee
agree on certain foundational points. When a debtor files for
bankruptcy, it “creates an estate” that includes virtually all the
debtor’s assets. 11 U. S. C. §541(a). Under Chapter 11,
the debtor can work with its creditors to develop a reorganization
plan governing the distribution of the estate’s assets; it must
then present that plan to the bankruptcy court and win its
approval. §§1121, 1123, 1129, 1141. Once the bankruptcy court
issues an order confirming the plan, that document binds the debtor
and its creditors going forward—even those who did not assent to
the plan. §1141(a).

															Most relevant here, a bankruptcy court’s order
confirming a plan “discharges the debtor from any debt that arose
before the date of such confirmation,” except as provided in the
plan, the confirmation order, or the code. §1141(d)(1)(A). That
discharge not only releases or “void[s] any past or future
judgments on the” discharged debt; it also “operat[es] as an
injunction . . . prohibit[ing] creditors from attempting
to collect or to recover the debt.” Tennessee Student Assistance
Corporation v. Hood, 541 U.S.
440, 447 (2004) (citing §§524(a)(1), (2)). Generally, however,
a discharge operates only for the benefit of the debtor against its
creditors and “does not affect the liability of any other entity.”
§524(e).

															The Sacklers have not filed for bankruptcy and
have not placed virtually all their assets on the table for
distribution to creditors, yet they seek what essentially amounts
to a discharge. They hope to win a judicial order releasing pending
claims against them brought by opioid victims. They seek an
injunction “permanently and forever” foreclosing similar suits in
the future. 1 App. 279. And they seek all this without the consent
of those affected. The question we face thus boils down to whether
a court in bankruptcy may effectively extend to nondebtors
the benefits of a Chapter 11 discharge usually reserved for
debtors.

															A

															For an answer, we turn to §1123. It addresses
the “[c]ontents”—or terms—of the bankruptcy reorganization plan a
debtor presents and a court approves in Chapter 11 proceedings.
Some plan terms are mandatory, §1123(a); others are optional,
§1123(b). No one suggests that anything like the Sackler discharge
must be included in a debtor’s reorganization plan. Instead,
plan proponents contend, it is a provision a debtor may
include and a court may approve in a reorganization
plan.

															Section 1123(b) governs that question. It
directs that a plan “may”:

															“(1)impair or leave unimpaired any class of
claims, secured or unsecured, or of interests;

															“(2). . . provide for the assumption,
rejection, or assignment of any executory contract or unexpired
lease of the debtor not previously rejected under [§365];

															“(3)provide for—

															“(A)the settlement or adjustment of any claim
or interest belonging to the debtor or to the estate; or

															“(B)the retention and enforcement by the
debtor, by the trustee, or by a representative of the estate
appointed for such purpose, of any such claim or interest;

															“(4)provide for the sale of all or
substantially all of the property of the estate, and the
distribution of the proceeds of such sale among holders of claims
or interests;

															“(5)modify the rights of holders of secured
claims, other than a claim secured only by a security interest in
real property that is the debtor’s principal residence, or of
holders of unsecured claims, or leave unaffected the rights of
holders of any class of claims; and

															“(6)include any other appropriate provision not
inconsistent with the applicable provisions of this title.”

															We can easily rule out the first five of these
paragraphs as potential sources of legal authority for the Sackler
discharge. They permit a plan to address claims and property
belonging to a debtor or its estate. §§1123(b)(2), (3), (4). They
permit a plan to modify the rights of creditors who hold claims
against the debtor or its estate. §§1123(b)(1), (5). But nothing in
those paragraphs authorizes a plan to extinguish claims against
third parties, like the Sacklers, without the consent of the
affected claimants, like the opioid victims. If authority for the
Sackler discharge can be found anywhere, it must be found in
paragraph (6). That is the paragraph on which the Second Circuit
primarily rested its decision below, and it is the one on which
plan proponents pin their case here.[2]

															As the plan proponents see it, paragraph (6)
allows a debtor to include in its plan, and a court to order,
any term not “expressly forbid[den]” by the bankruptcy code
as long as a bankruptcy judge deems it “appropriate” and consistent
with the broad “purpose[s]” of bankruptcy. 69 F. 4th, at
73–74; post, at 41–42 (Kavanaugh, J., dissenting). And
because the code does not expressly forbid a nonconsensual
nondebtor discharge, the reasoning goes, the bankruptcy court was
free to authorize one here after finding it an “appropriate”
provision. See Brief for Sackler Family 19–21; Brief for Purdue 20;
post, at 13–15.

															This understanding of the statute faces an
immediate obstacle. Paragraph (6) is a catchall phrase tacked on at
the end of a long and detailed list of specific directions. When
faced with a catchall phrase like that, courts do not necessarily
afford it the broadest possible construction it can bear. Epic
Systems Corp. v. Lewis, 584 U.S. 497, 512 (2018).
Instead, we generally appreciate that the catchall must be
interpreted in light of its surrounding context and read to
“embrace only objects similar in nature” to the specific examples
preceding it. Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted). So,
for example, when a statute sets out a list discussing “cars,
trucks, motorcycles, or any other vehicles,” we appreciate that the
catchall phrase may reach similar landbound vehicles (perhaps
including buses and camper vans), but it does not reach dissimilar
“vehicles” (such as airplanes and submarines). See McBoyle
v. United States, 283 U.S.
25, 26–27 (1931). This ancient interpretive principle,
sometimes called the ejusdem generis canon, seeks to afford
a statute the scope a reasonable reader would attribute to it.

															Viewed with that much in mind, we do not think
paragraph (6) affords a bankruptcy court the authority the plan
proponents suppose. In some circumstances, it may be difficult to
discern what a statute’s specific listed items share in common. See
A. Scalia & B. Garner, Reading Law 207–208 (2012). But here an
obvious link exists: When Congress authorized “appropriate” plan
provisions in paragraph (6), it did so only after enumerating five
specific sorts of provisions, all of which concern the
debtor—its rights and responsibilities, and its relationship
with its creditors. Doubtless, paragraph (6) operates to confer
additional authorities on a bankruptcy court. See United
States v. Energy Resources Co., 495
U.S. 545, 549 (1990). But the catchall cannot be fairly read to
endow a bankruptcy court with the “radically different” power to
discharge the debts of a nondebtor without the consent of affected
nondebtor claimants. Epic Systems Corp., 584 U. S., at
513; see also RadLAX Gateway Hotel, LLC v. Amalgamated
Bank, 566 U.S.
639, 645–647 (2012).

															The catchall’s text underscores the point.
Congress could have said in paragraph (6) that “everything not
expressly prohibited is permitted.” But it didn’t. Instead,
Congress set out a detailed list of powers, followed by a catchall
that it qualified with the term “appropriate.” That
quintessentially “context dependent” term often draws its meaning
from surrounding provisions. Sossamon v. Texas,
563 U.S.
277, 286 (2011). And we know to look to the statute’s preceding
specific paragraphs as the relevant “context” here because
paragraph (6) tells us so. It permits “any other appropriate
provision”—that is, “other” than the provisions already discussed
in paragraphs (1) through (5). (Emphasis added.) Each of those
“other” paragraphs authorizes a bankruptcy court to adjust claims
without consent only to the extent such claims concern the debtor.
From this, it follows naturally that an “appropriate provision”
adopted pursuant to the catchall that purports to extinguish claims
without consent should be similarly constrained. See, e.g.,
Epic Systems Corp., 584 U. S., at 512–513.

															For its part, the dissent does not dispute that
the ejusdem generis canon applies to §1123(b)(6).
Post, at 33–34; see also Brief for Sackler Family 44; Brief
for Purdue 23. But it disagrees with our application of the canon
for two reasons. First, the dissent claims, it “is factually
incorrect” to suggest that all the provisions of §1123(b) concern
the debtor’s rights and responsibilities. Post, at 35. The
dissent points out that a bankruptcy estate may settle creditors’
“derivative claims” against nondebtors under paragraph (3).
Post, at 36. And this “indisputable point,” the
dissent declares, “defeats the Court’s conclusion that §1123(b)’s
provisions relate only to the debtor and do not allow releases of
claims that victims and creditors hold against nondebtors.”
Post, at 37; see Brief for Purdue 24–25.

															But that argument contains a glaring flaw. The
dissent neglects why a bankruptcy court may resolve derivate
claims under paragraph (3): It may because those claims belong to
the debtor’s estate. See, e.g., In re Ontos,
Inc., 478 F.3d 427, 433 (CA1 2007). In a derivative action, the
named plaintiff “is only a nominal plaintiff. The substantive claim
belongs to the corporation.” 2 J. Macey, Corporation Laws
§13.20[D], p. 13–140 (2020–4 Supp.). And no one questions that
Purdue may address in its own bankruptcy plan claims “wherever
located and by whomever held,” §541(a)—including those claims
derivatively asserted by another on its behalf, see §1123(b)(3).
The problem is, the Sackler discharge is nothing like that. Rather
than seek to resolve claims that substantively belong to Purdue, it
seeks to extinguish claims against the Sacklers that belong to
their victims. And precisely nothing in §1123(b) suggests those
claims can be bargained away without the consent of those affected,
as if the claims were somehow Purdue’s own property.[3]

															Having come up short on the text of §1123(b),
the dissent pivots to the statute’s purpose. Post, at 35. As
the dissent sees it, our application of the ejusdem generis
canon should focus less on the provisions preceding the catchall
and more on the overall “purpose of bankruptcy law” in solving
“collective-action problem[s].” Post, at 5, 35–36; see also
Brief for Purdue 21. But there is an obvious difficulty with this
approach, too. As this Court has long recognized, “[n]o statute
pursues a single policy at all costs.” Bartenwerfer v.
Buckley, 598 U.S. 69, 81 (2023). Always, the question we
face is how far Congress has gone in pursuing one policy or
another. See ibid. So, yes, bankruptcy law may serve to
address some collective-action problems, but no one (save perhaps
the dissent) thinks it provides a bankruptcy court with a roving
commission to resolve all such problems that happen its way, blind
to the role other mechanisms (legislation, class actions,
multi-district litigation, consensual settlements, among others)
play in addressing them. And here, the five paragraphs that precede
the catchall tell us that bankruptcy courts may have many powers,
including the power to address certain collective-action problems
when they implicate the debtor’s rights and responsibilities. But
those directions also indicate that a bankruptcy court’s powers are
not limitless and do not endow it with the power to extinguish
without their consent claims held by nondebtors (here, the opioid
victims) against other nondebtors (here, the Sacklers).[4]

															B

															When resolving a dispute about a statute’s
meaning, we sometimes look for guidance not just in its immediate
terms but in related provisions as well. See, e.g.,
Turkiye Halk Bankasi A. S. v. United States, 598 U.S.
264, 275 (2023). Paragraph (6) itself alludes to this fact by
instructing that any plan term adopted under its auspices must not
be “inconsistent with the applicable provisions of ” the
bankruptcy code. Following that direction and looking to Chapter 11
more broadly, we find at least three further reasons why
§1123(b)(6) cannot bear the interpretation the plan proponents and
the dissent would have us give it.

															First, consider what is and who can earn a
discharge. As we have seen, a discharge releases the debtor from
its debts and enjoins future efforts to collect them—even by those
who do not assent to the debtor’s reorganization plan.
§§524(a)(1)–(2), 1129(b)(1), 1141(a). Generally, too, the
bankruptcy code reserves this benefit to “the debtor”—the entity
that files for bankruptcy. §1141(d)(1)(A); accord, §524(e); see
also §§727(a)–(b). The plan proponents and the dissent’s reading of
§1123(b)(6) would defy these rules by effectively affording to a
nondebtor a discharge usually reserved for the debtor alone.

															Second, notice how the code constrains the
debtor. To win a discharge, again as we have seen, the code
generally requires the debtor to come forward with virtually all
its assets. §§541(a)(1), 548. Nor is the discharge a debtor
receives unbounded. It does not reach claims based on “fraud” or
those alleging “willful and malicious injury.” §§523(a)(2), (4),
(6). And it cannot “affect any right to trial by jury” a creditor
may have “with regard to a personal injury or wrongful death tort
claim.” 28 U. S. C. §1411(a). The plan proponents
and the dissent’s reading of §1123(b)(6) transgresses all these
limits too. The Sacklers have not agreed to place anything
approaching their full assets on the table for opioid victims. Yet
they seek a judicial order that would extinguish virtually all
claims against them for fraud, willful injury, and even wrongful
death, all without the consent of those who have brought and seek
to bring such claims. In each of these ways, the Sacklers seek to
pay less than the code ordinarily requires and receive more than it
normally permits.

															Finally, there is a notable exception to the
code’s general rules. For asbestos-related bankruptcies—and only
for such bankruptcies—Congress has provided that,
“[n]otwithstanding” the usual rule that a debtor’s discharge does
not affect the liabilities of others on that same debt, §524(e),
courts may issue “an injunction . . . bar[ring] any
action directed against a third party” under certain statutorily
specified circumstances. §524(g)(4)(A)(ii). That the code
does authorize courts to enjoin claims against third parties
without their consent, but does so in only one context,
makes it all the more unlikely that §1123(b)(6) is best read to
afford courts that same authority in every context. See,
e.g., Bittner v. United States, 598
U.S. 85, 94 (2023); AMG Capital Management, LLC v.
FTC, 593 U.S. 67, 77 (2021).[5]

															How do the plan proponents and the dissent reply
to all this? Essentially, they ask us to look the other way.
Whatever limits the code imposes on debtors and discharges mean
nothing, they say, because the Sacklers seek a “release,” not a
“discharge.” See, e.g., post, at 46–48. But word
games cannot obscure the underlying reality. Once more, the
Sacklers seek greater relief than a bankruptcy discharge normally
affords, for they hope to extinguish even claims for wrongful death
and fraud, and they seek to do so without putting anything close to
all their assets on the table. Nor is what the Sacklers seek a
traditional release, for they hope to have a court extinguish
claims of opioid victims without their consent. See, e.g.,
J. Macey, Corporate Governance: Promises Kept, Promises Broken 152
(2008) (“settlements are, by definition, consensual”); accord,
Firefighters v. Cleveland, 478
U.S. 501, 529 (1986). Describe the relief the Sacklers seek how
you will, nothing in the bankruptcy code contemplates (much less
authorizes) it.

															C

															If text and context supply two strikes against
the plan proponents and the dissent’s construction of §1123(b)(6),
history offers a third. When Congress enacted the present
bankruptcy code in 1978, it did “not write ‘on a clean
slate.’ ” Hall v. United States, 566 U.S.
506, 523 (2012) (quoting Dewsnup v. Timm,
502 U.S.
410, 419 (1992)). Recognizing as much, this Court has said that
pre-code practice may sometimes inform our interpretation of the
code’s more “ambiguous” provisions. RadLAX Gateway Hotel,
566 U. S., at 649.

															While we discern no ambiguity in §1123(b)(6) for
the reasons explored above, historical practice confirms the lesson
we take from it. Every bankruptcy law the parties and their
amici have pointed us to, from 1800 until 1978, generally
reserved the benefits of discharge to the debtor who offered a
“fair and full surrender of [its] property.” Sturges v.
Crowninshield, 4 Wheat. 122, 176 (1819); accord, Central
Va. Community College v. Katz, 546
U.S. 356, 363–364 (2006); see, e.g., Bankruptcy
Act of 1800, §5, 2Stat. 23 (repealed 1803); Act of Aug. 19, 1841,
§3, 5Stat. 442–443 (repealed 1843); Act of Mar. 2, 1867, §§11, 29,
14Stat. 521, 531–532 (repealed 1878); Bankruptcy Act of 1898, §§7,
14, 30Stat. 548, 550 (repealed 1978). No one has directed us to a
statute or case suggesting American courts in the past enjoyed the
power in bankruptcy to discharge claims brought by nondebtors
against other nondebtors, all without the consent of those
affected. Surely, if Congress had meant to reshape traditional
practice so profoundly in the present bankruptcy code, extending to
courts the capacious new power the plan proponents claim, one might
have expected it to say so expressly “somewhere in the [c]ode
itself.” Dewsnup, 502 U. S., at 420.[6]

															Faced with so many marks against its
interpretation of the law, plan proponents and the dissent resort
to a policy argument. The Sacklers, they remind us, have signaled
that they will not return any funds to Purdue’s estate unless the
bankruptcy court grants them the sweeping nonconsensual release and
injunction they seek. Absent these concessions, plan proponents and
the dissent emphatically predict, “there will be no viable path”
for victims to recover even $3,500 each. Tr. of Oral Arg. 100;
Brief for Sackler Family 27; see Brief for Respondent Official
Committee of Unsecured Creditors of Purdue Pharma L. P.
et al. 45–46; post, at 4, 21–28, 52–54.

															The U. S. Trustee disputes that assessment.
Yes, he says, reversing the Second Circuit may cause Purdue’s
current reorganization plan to unravel. But that would also mean
the Sacklers would face lawsuits by individual victims, States,
other governmental entities, and perhaps even fraudulent-transfer
claims from the bankruptcy estate. So much legal exposure, the
Trustee asserts, may induce the Sacklers to negotiate
consensual releases on terms more favorable to opioid
victims. Brief for Petitioner 47–48. The Sacklers may “want global
peace,” the Trustee acknowledges, but that doesn’t “mea[n] that
they wouldn’t pay a lot for 97.5 percent peace.” Tr. of Oral Arg.
26. After all, the Trustee reminds us, during the appeal in this
very case, the Sacklers agreed to increase their contribution by
more than $1 billion in order to secure the consent of the eight
objecting States. If past is prologue, the Trustee says, there may
be a better deal on the horizon.[7]

															Even putting that aside, the Trustee urges us to
consider the ramifications of this case for others. Nonconsensual
third-party releases, he observes, allow tortfeasors to win
immunity from the claims of their victims, including for claims
(like wrongful death and fraud) they could not discharge in
bankruptcy, and do so without placing anything approaching all of
their assets on the table. Endorsing that maneuver, the Trustee
says, would provide a “roadmap for corporations and wealthy
individuals to misuse the bankruptcy system” in future cases “to
avoid mass-tort liability.” Brief for Petitioner 44–45.

															Both sides of this policy debate may have their
points. But, in the end, we are the wrong audience for them. As the
people’s elected representatives, Members of Congress enjoy the
power, consistent with the Constitution, to make policy judgments
about the proper scope of a bankruptcy discharge. Someday, Congress
may choose to add to the bankruptcy code special rules for
opioid-related bankruptcies as it has for asbestos-related cases.
Or it may choose not to do so. Either way, if a policy decision
like that is to be made, it is for Congress to make. Despite the
misimpression left by today’s dissent, our only proper task is to
interpret and apply the law as we find it; and nothing in present
law authorizes the Sackler discharge.

															IV

															As important as the question we decide today
are ones we do not. Nothing in what we have said should be
construed to call into question consensual third-party
releases offered in connection with a bankruptcy reorganization
plan; those sorts of releases pose different questions and may rest
on different legal grounds than the nonconsensual release at issue
here. See, e.g., In re Specialty Equipment
Cos., 
3 F.3d 1043, 1047 (CA7 1993). Nor do we have occasion today to
express a view on what qualifies as a consensual release or pass
upon a plan that provides for the full satisfaction of claims
against a third-party nondebtor. Additionally, because this case
involves only a stayed reorganization plan, we do not address
whether our reading of the bankruptcy code would justify unwinding
reorganization plans that have already become effective and been
substantially consummated. Confining ourselves to the question
presented, we hold only that the bankruptcy code does not authorize
a release and injunction that, as part of a plan of reorganization
under Chapter 11, effectively seeks to discharge claims against a
nondebtor without the consent of affected claimants. Because the
Second Circuit ruled otherwise, its judgment is reversed and the
case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this
opinion.

															

															It is so ordered.

 The Sacklers suggest
that, if 11 U. S. C. §1123(b) does not permit a
bankruptcy court to release and enjoin claims against a nondebtor
without the affected claimants’ consent, §105(a) does. See Brief
for Mortimer-Side Initial Covered Respondents 19 (Brief for Sackler
Family). That provision allows a bankruptcy court to “issue any
order, process, or judgment that is necessary or appropriate to
carry out the provisions of ” the bankruptcy code. §105(a). As
the Second Circuit recognized, however, “§105(a) alone cannot
justify” the imposition of nonconsensual third-party releases
because it serves only to “ ‘carry out’ ” authorities
expressly conferred elsewhere in the code. 69 F. 4th 45, 73
(2023) (quoting §105(a)); see also 2 R. Levin & H. Sommer,
Collier on Bankruptcy ¶105.01[1], p. 105–6 (16th ed. 2023).
Purdue concedes this point, Brief for Debtor Respondents 19,
n. 5 (Brief for Purdue), as do several other plan proponents,
see, e.g., Brief for Respondent Ad Hoc Committee 29.
Necessarily, then, our focus trains on §1123(b)(6).
3
 In an effort to blur this
distinction, the dissent points out that the Sackler discharge
covers claims for which Purdue’s conduct is a “legally relevant
factor.” Post, at 34–35 (quoting 69 F. 4th, at 80). But that
does not alter the fact that the Sackler discharge would extinguish
the victims’ claims against the Sacklers.
Those claims neither belong to Purdue nor are they asserted against
Purdue or its estate. The dissent disregards these elemental
distinctions. See, e.g., post, at 49
(conflating the estate’s power to settle its own fraudulent
transfer claims against the Sacklers with the power to extinguish
those of the victims against the Sacklers).
4
 The dissent characterizes
our analysis of paragraph (6) as “breez[y],” as if the analysis
would be correct if only it were belabored. Post, at 34. And
yet it is the dissent that relegates the text of the relevant
statute, §1123(b), to a pair of footnotes bookending a 25-page
exposition on collective-action problems and public policy, one
that precedes any effort to engage with our statutory analysis. See
post, at 7, n. 1, 32, n. 5.
5
 The dissent claims that,
in making this observation, we defy §524(g)’s directive that
“[n]othing in [it], or in the amendments made by [its addition to
the bankruptcy code], shall be construed to modify, impair, or
supersede any other authority the court has to issue injunctions in
connection with an order confirming a plan of reorganization.”
108Stat. 4117, note following 11 U. S. C. §524; see
post, at 44–45. That charge misunderstands the point. We do
not read §524(g) to “impair” or “modify” authority previously
available to courts in bankruptcy. To the contrary, we simply
understand §524(g) to illustrate how Congress might proceed if it
intended to confer upon bankruptcy courts a novel and extraordinary
power to extinguish claims against third parties without claimants’
consent. See Czyzewski v. Jevic Holding Corp., 580
U.S. 451, 465 (2017).
6
 The dissent declares
pre-code practice irrelevant to the task at hand and insists the
power to order nonconsensual releases has been settled by “decades”
of bankruptcy court practice. Post, at 3, 5, 8, 11, 50–51.
But in resisting the notion that pre-code practice may inform our
work, the dissent defies our precedents. And in appealing to
“decades” of lower court practice, the dissent seems to forget why
we took this case in the first place: to resolve a longstanding and
deeply entrenched disagreement between lower courts over the
legality of nonconsensual third-party releases. See n. 1,
supra.
7
 The parties likewise spar
over whether, absent the Sacklers’ discharge, the family could
deplete the estate by asserting indemnification claims against the
company. Plan proponents and the dissent point to a 2004 agreement
that commits Purdue to cover certain liability and legal expenses
the Sacklers incur. Brief for Purdue 10; post, at 21–24. But
here again, the Trustee sees things differently. He underscores the
plan proponents’ concession that the 2004 agreement “does not apply
if a court determines the Sacklers ‘did not act in good
faith.’ ” Reply Brief 16. And, he adds, bankruptcy courts have
a variety of statutory tools at their disposal to disallow or
equitably subordinate any potential indemnification claims the
Sacklers might pursue. Ibid. (citing §§502(e)(1)(B),
510(c)(1)).
