															SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

															SYLVIA GONZALEZ, PETITIONER v. EDWARD
TREVINO, II, et al.

															on writ of certiorari to the united states
court of appeals for the fifth circuit

															[June 20, 2024]

															

															Justice Kavanaugh, concurring.

															Sylvia Gonzalez was arrested for intentionally
stealing a government record. See Tex. Penal Code Ann. §37.10(a)(3)
(West Cum. Supp. 2023). Gonzalez sued city officials under 42
U. S. C. §1983, alleging that she was arrested in
retaliation for First Amendment-protected activity.

															But Gonzalez conceded that city officials had
probable cause to arrest her for intentionally removing the
government record. (A video shows Gonzalez putting the government
record into her binder at a city council meeting. See ante,
at 1–4 (Alito, J., concurring).) An arrestee ordinarily cannot sue
a public official under §1983 for retaliatory arrest if the
official had probable cause to make the arrest. See Nieves
v. Bartlett, 587 U.S. 391, 404 (2019). To somehow maintain
her §1983 suit, Gonzalez invoked what is known as the Nieves
exception. That exception applies when an individual is arrested
for minor criminal conduct where officers “typically exercise their
discretion not” to arrest. Id., at 406. The prime example is
jaywalking. Id., at 407.

															To come within the Nieves exception,
Gonzalez was required to present “objective evidence” that she was
arrested when “similarly situated individuals” who engaged in the
same conduct would not have been arrested. Ibid. Of
course, Gonzalez could not plausibly claim that people in Texas who
steal things (or more precisely here, who steal government records)
do not get arrested. Instead, she says that she took the government
record accidentally, not intentionally, and that people who
accidentally remove government documents are not arrested.

															Properly understood, that is not a
Nieves-exception claim at all. The Nieves exception
is a conduct-based comparison. Only if the conduct does not usually
trigger an arrest under any statute can you have a
Nieves-exception claim—like jaywalking. Gonzalez’s argument
turns not on her conduct (taking government records) but rather on
her mens rea. She essentially argues that an objectively
reasonable officer would have known that Gonzalez accidentally
rather than intentionally took the government record.

															When Gonzalez conceded that the officials had
probable cause to arrest her, however, she necessarily conceded
that the officers had probable cause to conclude that she
“intentionally” removed the document. Tex. Penal Code Ann.
§37.10(a)(3). That may have been an unwise concession. But it
should have foreclosed Gonzalez’s attempt to contest her mens
rea for purposes of her §1983 retaliatory arrest claim. And
even if Gonzalez had not made the concession, the question here
would be whether an objectively reasonable officer would have known
that Gonzalez accidentally (rather than intentionally) took the
document. In short, this is (at most) a case about probable cause
as to mens rea, not about conduct-based comparisons. This
case has nothing to do with the Nieves exception.

															At this point, the Court’s grant of certiorari
looks ill-advised given that the question presented about the
Nieves exception bears no relation to the issue on which
Gonzalez’s suit actually turns. In any event, we are where we are.
I concur in the per curiam because the per curiam
does not seem to say anything that is harmful to the law, even
though the per curiam (in my view) does not really have
anything to do with Gonzalez’s case.
