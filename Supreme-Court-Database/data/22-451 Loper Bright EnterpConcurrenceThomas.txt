															Justice Thomas, concurring.

															I join the Court’s opinion in full because it
correctly concludes that Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v.
Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U.S.
837 (1984), must finally be overruled. Under Chevron, a
judge was required to adopt an agency’s interpretation of an
ambiguous statute, so long as the agency had a “permissible
construction of the statute.” See id., at 843. As the Court
explains, that deference does not comport with the Administrative
Procedure Act, which requires judges to decide “all relevant
questions of law” and “interpret constitutional and statutory
provisions” when reviewing an agency action. 5 U. S. C.
§706; see also ante, at 18–23; Baldwin v. United
States, 589 U. S. ___, ___–___ (2020) (Thomas, J.,
dissenting from denial of certiorari) (slip op., at 4–5).

															I write separately to underscore a more
fundamental problem: Chevron deference also violates our
Constitution’s separation of powers, as I have previously explained
at length. See Baldwin, 589 U. S., at ___–___
(dissenting opinion) (slip op., at 2–4); Michigan v.
EPA, 576 U.S.
743, 761–763 (2015) (concurring opinion); see also Perez
v. Mortgage Bankers Assn., 575 U.S.
92, 115–118 (2015) (opinion concurring in judgment). And, I
agree with Justice Gorsuch that we should not overlook
Chevron’s constitutional defects in overruling it.[1]* Post, at 15–20 (concurring
opinion). To provide “practical and real protections for individual
liberty,” the Framers drafted a Constitution that divides the
legislative, executive, and judicial powers between three branches
of Government. Perez, 575 U. S., at 118 (opinion of
Thomas, J.). Chevron deference compromises this separation
of powers in two ways. It curbs the judicial power afforded to
courts, and simultaneously expands agencies’ executive power beyond
constitutional limits.

															Chevron compels judges to abdicate their
Article III “judicial Power.” §1. “[T]he judicial power, as
originally understood, requires a court to exercise its independent
judgment in interpreting and expounding upon the laws.”
Perez, 575 U. S., at 119 (opinion of Thomas, J.);
accord, post, at 17–18 (opinion of Gorsuch, J.). The Framers
understood that “legal texts . . . often contain
ambiguities,” and that the judicial power included “the power to
resolve these ambiguities over time.” Perez, 575 U. S.,
at 119 (opinion of Thomas, J.); accord, ante, at 7–9. But,
under Chevron, a judge must accept an agency’s
interpretation of an ambiguous law, even if he thinks another
interpretation is correct. Ante, at 19. Chevron
deference thus prevents judges from exercising their independent
judgment to resolve ambiguities. Baldwin, 589 U. S., at
___ (opinion of Thomas, J.) (slip op., at 3); see also
Michigan, 576 U. S., at 761 (opinion of Thomas, J.);
see also Perez, 575 U. S., at 123 (opinion of Thomas,
J.). By tying a judge’s hands, Chevron prevents the
Judiciary from serving as a constitutional check on the Executive.
It allows “the Executive . . . to dictate the outcome of
cases through erroneous interpretations.” Baldwin, 589
U. S., at ___ (opinion of Thomas, J.) (slip op., at 4);
Michigan, 576 U. S., at 763, n. 1 (opinion of Thomas,
J.); see also Perez, 575 U. S., at 124 (opinion of
Thomas, J.). Because the judicial power requires judges to exercise
their independent judgment, the deference that Chevron
requires contravenes Article III’s mandate.

															Chevron deference also permits the
Executive Branch to exercise powers not given to it. “When the
Government is called upon to perform a function that requires an
exercise of legislative, executive, or judicial power, only the
vested recipient of that power can perform it.” Department of
Transportation v. Association of American Railroads,
575 U.S.
43, 68 (2015) (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment). Because the
Constitution gives the Executive Branch only “[t]he executive
Power,” executive agencies may constitutionally exercise only that
power. Art. II, §1, cl. 1. But, Chevron gives
agencies license to exercise judicial power. By allowing agencies
to definitively interpret laws so long as they are ambiguous,
Chevron “transfer[s]” the Judiciary’s “interpretive judgment
to the agency.” Perez, 575 U. S., at 124 (opinion of
Thomas, J.); see also Baldwin, 589 U. S., at ___
(opinion of Thomas, J.) (slip op., at 4); Michigan, 576
U. S., at 761–762 (opinion of Thomas, J.); post, at 18
(Gorsuch, J., concurring).

															Chevron deference “cannot be salvaged” by
recasting it as deference to an agency’s “formulation of policy.”
Baldwin, 589 U. S., at ___ (opinion of Thomas, J.)
(internal quotation marks omitted) (slip op., at 3). If that were
true, Chevron would mean that “agencies are
unconstitutionally exercising ‘legislative Powers’ vested in
Congress.” Baldwin, 589 U. S., at ___ (opinion of
Thomas, J.) (slip op., at 3) (quoting Art. I, §1). By “giv[ing] the
force of law to agency pronouncements on matters of private conduct
as to which Congress did not actually have an intent,”
Chevron “permit[s] a body other than Congress to perform a
function that requires an exercise of legislative power.”
Michigan, 576 U. S., at 762 (opinion of Thomas, J.)
(internal quotation marks omitted). No matter the gloss put on it,
Chevron expands agencies’ power beyond the bounds of Article
II by permitting them to exercise powers reserved to another branch
of Government.

															Chevron deference was “not a harmless
transfer of power.” Baldwin, 589 U. S., at ___ (opinion
of Thomas, J.) (slip op., at 3). “The Constitution carefully
imposes structural constraints on all three branches, and the
exercise of power free of those accompanying restraints subverts
the design of the Constitution’s ratifiers.” Ibid. In
particular, the Founders envisioned that “the courts [would] check
the Executive by applying the correct interpretation of the law.”
Id., at ___ (slip op., at 4). Chevron was thus a
fundamental disruption of our separation of powers. It improperly
strips courts of judicial power by simultaneously increasing the
power of executive agencies. By overruling Chevron, we
restore this aspect of our separation of powers. To safeguard
individual liberty, “[s]tructure is everything.” A. Scalia,
Foreword: The Importance of Structure in Constitutional
Interpretation, 83 Notre Dame L. Rev. 1417, 1418 (2008).
Although the Court finally ends our 40-year misadventure with
Chevron deference, its more profound problems should not be
overlooked. Regardless of what a statute says, the type of
deference required by Chevron violates the Constitution.

Notes

*There is much to be commended
in Justice Gorsuch’s careful consideration from first principles of
the weight we should afford to our precedent. I agree with the
lion’s share of his concurrence. See generally Gamble v.
United States, 587 U.S. 678, 710 (2019) (Thomas, J.,
concurring).
