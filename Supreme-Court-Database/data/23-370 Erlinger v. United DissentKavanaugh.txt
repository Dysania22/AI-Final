															SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

															_________________

															No. 23–370

															_________________

															PAUL ERLINGER, PETITIONER v. UNITED
STATES

															on writ of certiorari to the united states
court of appeals for the seventh circuit

															[June 21, 2024]

															

															Justice Kavanaugh, with whom Justice Alito
joins, and with whom Justice Jackson joins except as to Part III,
dissenting.

															To prevent and punish violent crime committed
with firearms, Congress has enacted numerous federal laws—most
notably the National Firearms Act of 1934, the Gun Control Act of
1968, and the Armed Career Criminal Act of 1984. This case concerns
the Armed Career Criminal Act.

															As relevant here, ACCA imposes a minimum
sentence on a defendant who previously was convicted of at least
three violent felonies committed on different occasions—and who
then, after the three prior violent felony convictions, unlawfully
possessed a firearm. In applying ACCA’s minimum sentencing
requirement, the Sixth Amendment allows a judge to determine
whether the defendant has three or more prior convictions and
whether those convictions were for violent felonies. The question
in this case is whether the judge may also determine whether the
defendant committed those prior crimes on different occasions, or
instead whether a jury must do so.

															In my view, this Court’s precedents establish
that a judge may make the different-occasions determination.
Because the Court today concludes that only a jury may make the
different-occasions determination, I respectfully dissent.

															I

															Paul Erlinger has been convicted of at least 9
felonies, including at least 7 burglaries. Under federal law, he
therefore may not possess a firearm. See 18 U. S. C.
§922(g)(1). As a multiple-time convicted felon, Erlinger would have
received repeated notice that he could not legally possess any
firearms. Yet in 2017, the police received a tip that Erlinger had
recently violated that federal law and purchased a gun. Pursuant to
a search warrant, officers searched his home and found 20 guns—16
long guns and 4 handguns—and ammunition to go with them. Erlinger
pled guilty to possessing a firearm as a felon, in violation of
§922(g).

															At sentencing, the Government argued that the
Armed Career Criminal Act mandated a minimum prison sentence
because Erlinger had previously been convicted of at least three
violent felonies committed on different occasions. The Government
presented the charging documents and plea agreement for three
offenses that Erlinger committed in 1991: (i) an April 4 burglary
of a pizza restaurant; (ii) an April 8 burglary of a sporting-goods
store; and (iii) an April 11 burglary of another restaurant. The
U. S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana
determined that Erlinger had been convicted of each of those
burglaries, and that those offenses qualified as violent felonies.
Erlinger did not question the judge’s authority to make those
determinations. The District Court then concluded that Erlinger
committed the three burglaries on “occasions different from one
another.” §924(e)(1).

															On appeal, despite accepting the District
Court’s authority to determine whether he was convicted of the
three prior violent felonies, Erlinger argued that the Sixth
Amendment required a jury, not a judge, to determine whether he
committed the felonies on different occasions. That was not a
promising argument. Like all 11 other Courts of Appeals that handle
federal criminal cases, the U. S. Court of Appeals for the
Seventh Circuit had previously ruled that a judge may determine
whether a defendant’s prior felonies were committed on different
occasions. Adhering to that Circuit precedent, the Seventh Circuit
therefore rejected Erlinger’s argument. 77 F. 4th 617, 621–622
(2023) (citing United States v. Elliott, 703 F.3d
378, 382 (2012)).

															The Court today, however, rejects the unanimous
conclusion of the 12 Courts of Appeals. The Court holds that a jury
must determine whether a defendant committed his prior felonies on
different occasions. I respectfully disagree.

															II

															The Sixth Amendment guarantees criminal
defendants the right to a “trial” by an “impartial jury.” Relying
on text and history, this Court’s precedents have interpreted the
Sixth Amendment to draw a clear line between (i) the facts about
the present crime that a jury must decide at trial and (ii) the
facts about past crimes that a judge may determine at
sentencing.

															In a series of cases that began with
Apprendi v. New Jersey, the Court has held that a
jury must find facts about a defendant’s present offense that alter
the crime’s maximum or minimum possible sentence. 530
U.S. 466, 490 (2000). But Apprendi and this Court’s
subsequent cases have not disturbed the longstanding sentencing
rule that this Court recognized two years earlier in
Almendarez-Torres v. United States: Judges may
resolve questions about a defendant’s past crimes—questions of
recidivism—that are relevant not to the defendant’s guilt for the
present offense but rather to the length of the defendant’s
sentence. 523
U.S. 224, 239, 247 (1998).

															

															A

															This Court’s opinion in
Almendarez-Torres resolves the question of whether a judge
may decide if the defendant committed his prior violent offenses on
different occasions. In that case, the Court squarely held that
either a judge or a jury may apply sentence enhancements based on
“recidivism.” Id., at 247.

															Almendarez-Torres involved a statute that
made it a crime for a deported noncitizen to illegally reenter the
United States. Id., at 229. The maximum sentence for that
crime was 2 years. Ibid. But if the noncitizen had been
convicted of certain aggravated felonies before he was deported,
the maximum sentence for illegal reentry increased to 20 years.
Ibid.

															Almendarez-Torres argued that the Constitution
required “Congress to treat recidivism as an element of the
offense.” Id., at 239. If so, the Government would have to
prove to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt that Almendarez-Torres
had been convicted of an aggravated felony before his deportation.
Ibid. This Court rejected that argument. Id., at
247. Recidivism, the Court stated, “is a traditional, if not
the most traditional, basis for a sentencing court’s increasing an
offender’s sentence.” Id., at 243. It is not an element of
the present crime of illegal reentry. Id., at 247; see also
Jones v. United States, 526 U.S.
227, 249 (1999); Graham v. West Virginia,
224 U.S.
616, 629 (1912).

															The Court explained that the Federal and State
Governments have long taken different approaches to applying
recidivism sentencing enhancements. Almendarez-Torres, 523
U. S., at 246. Some provide a jury trial. Ibid. Others
assign recidivism enhancements to the sentencing judge.
Ibid.

															Given the absence of any “uniform” “tradition,”
the Court concluded that the choice between those methods was left
to the Legislature, not governed by “a federal constitutional
guarantee.” Id., at 246–247. To hold “that the Constitution
requires that recidivism be deemed an ‘element’ of petitioner’s
offense would mark an abrupt departure from a longstanding
tradition” where a judge or a jury could determine that a defendant
is a recidivist. Id., at 244.

															Importantly, that tradition of allowing judges
to apply recidivism sentencing enhancements developed so as to
avoid significant prejudice to criminal defendants. If the jury had
to determine recidivism, the jury would hear highly prejudicial
evidence about a defendant’s past criminal offenses at the trial
for the present crime. Id., at 235.

															In short, in Almendarez-Torres the Court
held that the Legislature can decide how it wants recidivism
enhancements to be applied—by a judge or by a jury. Id., at
246–247.

															ACCA mandates a minimum sentence if the
defendant had three prior convictions for violent felonies
committed on different occasions. Erlinger does not dispute that
Almendarez-Torres allows a judge to determine whether
Erlinger had three prior convictions for violent felonies. The
narrow question here is whether Almendarez-Torres also
allows a judge to determine whether Erlinger’s three prior offenses
were committed on different occasions.

															I would conclude that Almendarez-Torres
also applies to the different-occasions inquiry. Under
Almendarez-Torres, legislatures may assign to judges the
task of finding facts related to a defendant’s past crimes—that is,
to his “recidivism.” Id., at 239. That principle encompasses
the different-occasions inquiry.

															After all, the enhancement in
Almendarez-Torres applied when “the defendant was previously
deported subsequent to a conviction for commission of an aggravated
felony.” Id., at 235 (quotation marks omitted). To apply
that enhancement, a judge had to find the date on which the
defendant was convicted of the aggravated felony. The judge had to
find that the defendant in fact was the person who had committed
the aggravated felony. And the judge had to find that the defendant
had been deported after that date.

															Like the statute in Almendarez-Torres,
recidivism statutes often require a decisionmaker to determine the
who, what, when, and where of prior offenses. The
Almendarez-Torres Court had no difficulty concluding that
Congress could authorize judges to make the factual findings
necessary to apply the recidivism enhancement. Id., at 246.
To the extent that Almendarez-Torres left any doubt on that
score, this Court recognized the case’s “precise holding” the
following year: The “distinctive significance of recidivism”
distinguishes it from elements of the present crime. Jones,
526 U. S., at 248–249. Almendarez-Torres thus
means that judges can make all recidivism determinations at
sentencing. Only that rule can explain this Court’s cases allowing
judges to find recidivism-related facts. See, e.g.,
McNeill v. United States, 563
U.S. 816, 820, 824 (2011); Shepard v. United
States, 544 U.S.
13, 20–21 (2005).

															ACCA’s different-occasions requirement similarly
requires the judge to find the when and where of a defendant’s
prior criminal acts. Therefore, under Almendarez-Torres,
judges may make the different-occasions determination. Given the
Court’s opinion in Almendarez-Torres, it comes as no
surprise that all 12 Courts of Appeals have concluded that judges
may make the different-occasions determination. See United
States v. Ivery, 
427 F.3d 69, 74–75 (CA1 2005); United States v.
Santiago, 
268 F.3d 151, 156 (CA2 2001); United States v.
Blair, 734 F.3d 218, 227–228 (CA3 2013); United
States v. Brown, 67 F. 4th 200, 201 (CA4 2023);
United States v. Davis, 487 F.3d 282, 288 (CA5 2007);
United States v. Burgin, 
388 F.3d 177, 186 (CA6 2004); United States v.
Elliott, 703 F.3d 378, 381–383 (CA7 2012); United
States v. Harris, 794 F.3d 885, 887 (CA8 2015);
United States v. Walker, 953 F.3d 577, 580–582 (CA9
2020); United States v. Harris, 
447 F.3d 1300, 1304 (CA10 2006); United States v.
Weeks, 711 F.3d 1255, 1259 (CA11 2013); United States
v. Thomas, 572 F.3d 945, 952, n. 4 (CADC 2009).

															B

															In concluding that Almendarez-Torres
does not authorize judges to make the different-occasions
determination, the Court says that subsequent decisions of this
Court have “expressly delimited” the reach of
Almendarez-Torres. Ante, at 14–15, and n. 2
(citing United States v. Haymond, 588 U.S. 634, 644,
n. 3 (2019) (plurality opinion); Mathis v. United
States, 579 U.S. 500, 511–512 (2016); Descamps v.
United States, 570 U.S.
254, 269 (2013); Alleyne v. United States,
570 U.S.
99, 111, n. 1 (2013); Cunningham v. California,
549 U.S.
270, 282 (2007); Shepard, 544 U. S., at 24
(plurality opinion); Blakely v. Washington, 542 U.S.
296, 301 (2004); Apprendi, 530 U. S., at 490).

															But the cases cited by the Court do not support
its claim that Almendarez-Torres has been cabined, at least
not in a way that would require a jury to make the
different-occasions finding.

															Many of those cited cases did not involve
recidivism. Both Alleyne v. United States and
Apprendi v. New Jersey addressed the present crime,
not prior crimes. 570 U. S., at 104; 530 U. S., at
468–469. Neither case revisited Almendarez-Torres’s analysis
of the distinctive history of recidivism sentencing enhancements
for prior offenses. Indeed, both Alleyne and Apprendi
expressly declined to “revisit” Almendarez-Torres. 570
U. S., at 111, n. 1; 530 U. S., at 490. And in
analyzing Almendarez-Torres, Apprendi drew a clear
line between facts about prior crimes and facts about present
crimes. 530 U. S., at 488. Apprendi

															

															

															said as much multiple times. Id., at 474,
488–489, and n. 14, 496.[1]

															The other cases cited by the Court did not even
involve a constitutional claim. In Mathis v. United
States and Descamps v. United States, the Court
interpreted the text of ACCA in order to determine whether a prior
conviction constituted a “violent felony.” 579 U. S., at 503
(quotation marks omitted); 570 U. S., at 257 (same); see also
Shepard, 544 U. S., at 15–16, 19. To be sure, the Court
said that its interpretation of ACCA avoided “ Sixth Amendment
concerns.” Mathis, 579 U. S., at 511; Descamps,
570 U. S., at 267. But neither case purported to articulate
any Sixth Amendment holding.

															Importantly, constitutional avoidance “is not a
method of adjudicating constitutional questions by other means.”
Clark v. Martinez, 543 U.S.
371, 381 (2005). When the Court flags potential constitutional
concerns in a statutory case, that is a far cry from the Court’s
definitively resolving the potential constitutional issue, let
alone altering previously binding constitutional precedent. A prior
constitutional-avoidance holding does not absolve the Court of the
duty to address the constitutional issue head-on when it is later
presented to the Court. The Court’s decision today mistakenly
elevates constitutional-avoidance holdings to constitutional
holdings.

															Almendarez-Torres said what it said: The
Constitution does not require a jury to make recidivism
determinations. And no subsequent case of this Court has cabined
the holding of Almendarez-Torres. By distinguishing the
different-occasions issue from the other facts about prior crimes,
today’s decision mistakenly crosses the clear line that
Almendarez-Torres and Apprendi drew between facts
about the present offense and facts about prior offenses.[2]

															III

															Even accepting the Court’s interpretation of
the Sixth Amendment as to the different-occasions issue, Erlinger’s
sentence should be affirmed. As the Government says, any error was
harmless. Tr. of Oral Arg. 45.

															This Court has long ruled that most
constitutional errors, including Sixth Amendment errors, “can be
harmless.” Washington v. Recuenco, 548 U.S.
212, 218 (2006) (quotation marks omitted). The harmless-error
rule serves an important purpose. It ensures that appellate courts
do not set aside convictions or sentences “for small errors or
defects that have little, if any, likelihood of having changed the
result.” Neder v. United States, 527 U.S.
1, 19 (1999) (quotation marks omitted). So if a constitutional
error is harmless “beyond a reasonable doubt,” the defendant’s
conviction and sentence should be affirmed. Id., at 18.

															The harmless-error rule will likely ameliorate
some of the short-term problems that today’s decision otherwise
would

															cause. In any case that has not become final,
the relevant appellate court can apply harmless-error
analysis.[3]

															In most (if not all) cases, the fact that a
judge rather than a jury applied ACCA’s different-occasions
requirement will be harmless. Whether prior felonies occurred on
different occasions under ACCA is usually a straightforward
question. As this Court succinctly stated in Wooden, courts
“have nearly always treated offenses as occurring on separate
occasions if a person committed them a day or more apart, or at a
significant distance.” Wooden v. United States, 595
U.S. 360, 370 (2022) (quotation marks omitted). So in cases like
this where undisputed facts establish that the defendant’s prior
crimes occurred a day or more apart, it will usually be evident
beyond a reasonable doubt that the failure to submit the
different-occasions question to the jury had no effect on the
defendant’s sentence.[4]

															This case is a good example. There can be no
reasonable doubt that Erlinger committed three burglaries “on
occasions different from one another.” 18 U. S. C.
§924(e)(1). Erlinger burglarized three separate businesses, and
each burglary occurred several days apart from the other two. His
crimes had different victims, different dates, and different
locations. And when offered the opportunity to dispute the District
Court’s conclusion that he committed the three burglaries on
different occasions, “Erlinger supplied no argument or evidence
that would cast doubt” on the District Court’s analysis. 77
F. 4th, at 622.

															In this Court, Erlinger’s argument on harmless
error was not much more enlightening. When asked whether he had “a
viable argument” against harmless error, Erlinger responded that he
could “imagine somebody” who might. Tr. of Oral Arg. 25. For
example, Erlinger hypothesized that someone might commit a string
of burglaries several days apart to pay a single gambling debt.
Ibid. Of course, Erlinger did not argue that he actually fit
that description. And regardless, no “rational jury” could think
that separate burglaries days apart in different places collapse
into one occasion simply because the defendant committed the
burglaries to pay a single debt. Neder, 527 U. S., at
18.

															For those reasons, I would hold that any Sixth
Amendment error in this case was harmless. I recognize that this
Court often leaves harmless-error questions to the Court of Appeals
when the issue was not addressed below. See id., at 25. But
that is because harmless-error questions sometimes are
fact-intensive and require painstaking analysis of a large record.
Here, the relevant facts are simple and undisputed: Erlinger
committed three burglaries of three different businesses on three
different days, with several days separating each burglary. I would
resolve the harmless-error issue in this case now rather than
subjecting the parties to a pointless remand to the Court of
Appeals and another round of briefing and argument, when the Court
of Appeals’ decision is a foregone conclusion. The Court declines
to do so. But the harmless-error analysis will be straightforward
for the Court of Appeals on remand.

															IV

															The Court today has not overruled
Almendarez-Torres; it has simply carved out the
different-occasions inquiry from the general
Almendarez-Torres rule. But Justice Thomas has written
separately to advocate overruling Almendarez-Torres
altogether. Ante, at 2 (concurring opinion). And Erlinger
agreed that “the Court should someday” overrule that precedent. Tr.
of Oral Arg. 5.

															Applying the traditional stare decisis
factors, I am strongly opposed to overruling
Almendarez-Torres.

															The principle of stare decisis is
encompassed within the “judicial Power” of Article III of the
Constitution. Stare decisis “promotes the evenhanded,
predictable, and consistent development of legal principles,
fosters reliance on judicial decisions, and contributes to the
actual and perceived integrity of the judicial process.”
Payne v. Tennessee, 501 U.S.
808, 827 (1991). Of course, adherence to constitutional
precedent is not and should not be absolute. See Ramos v.
Louisiana, 590 U.S. 83, 116–117 (2020) (Kavanaugh, J.,
concurring in part). But the Court requires a “special
justification” or “strong grounds” before revisiting a settled
holding. Id., at 120 (quotation marks omitted). That
requirement “disciplines jurisprudential disagreement.” A. Barrett,
Precedent and Jurisprudential Disagreement, 91 Texas L. Rev.
1711, 1722 (2013).

															In general, when considering whether to overrule
a constitutional precedent, the Court analyzes a variety of factors
that often boil down to three basic questions. First, “is the prior
decision not just wrong, but grievously or egregiously wrong?”
Ramos, 590 U. S., at 121 (Kavanaugh, J., concurring in
part). Second, “has the prior decision caused significant negative
jurisprudential or real-world consequences?” Id., at 122.
And third, “would overruling the prior decision unduly upset
reliance interests?” Ibid.

															Overruling Almendarez-Torres would
require running the table on all three. As I see it, however, the
argument for overruling Almendarez-Torres does not satisfy
any of the three requirements.

															A

															On the merits, I believe that
Almendarez-Torres is correct in light of text and history.
But even if one thinks that the case is wrong, it certainly is not
egregiously wrong.

															The Sixth Amendment textually guarantees the
right to a jury trial, but its text does not specify all that the
right entails. Instead, to define the jury right, the Court has
looked to the common law, state practices in the founding era,
opinions and treatises written soon afterward, and this Nation’s
historical tradition. See Ramos, 590 U. S., at 90. When
those sources supply a clear answer, we can conclude that a rule is
part of the jury right enshrined in the Sixth Amendment and
therefore cannot be changed by the legislature. See id., at
90–92.

															No settled historical practice or understanding
establishes that a jury, rather than a judge, must determine for
sentencing purposes whether a defendant is a recidivist.

															Statutes that enhance repeat offenders’
sentences “have a long tradition in this country that dates back to
colonial times.” Parke v. Raley, 506 U.S.
20, 26 (1992). Given the prevalence of those statutes, if there
were a legal consensus that a jury had to determine a defendant’s
recidivism, we should be able to easily locate that consensus in
the States’ laws. After all, as the Court reminds us, every state
constitution ratified in the aftermath of the Revolution guaranteed
a right to a trial by jury. Ante, at 6. Those state
constitutional rights are analogous to the right guaranteed by the
Sixth Amendment.

															But the States have traditionally used a “wide
variety of methods of dealing with” recidivism enhancements.
Spencer v. Texas, 385 U.S.
554, 566 (1967); see also Almendarez-Torres v. United
States, 523 U.S.
224, 246–247 (1998). And some States have long given judges the
responsibility to find the facts necessary to apply a recidivism
sentencing enhancement for past crimes. States have done so to
avoid the prejudice to the defendant that would result from telling
the jury about the defendant’s prior crimes.

															One example is South Carolina. There, in the
1830s, the State had a steep recidivism enhancement for horse
thieves. State v. Smith, 8 Rich. 460 (S. C.
1832). The “Court, not the jury” decided whether the enhancement
applied. Id., at 461; see also State v. Allen,
8 Rich. 448, 449 (S. C. 1832); State v. Parris,
89 S. C. 140, 141, 71 S.E. 808, 809 (1911).

															Louisiana similarly recognized that facts about
recidivism “were not essential ingredients constituting the offense
charged, upon which the jury had to pass.” State v.
Hudson, 32 La. 1052, 1053 (1880). As the Supreme Court of
Louisiana later explained, there “is no provision in the
Constitution that we have been able to find which authorizes or
requires questions of fact not pertaining to the guilt or innocence
of a defendant to be submitted to a jury.” State v.
Guidry, 169 La. 215, 224, 124 So. 832, 835 (1929). Instead,
the court held that the Louisiana Legislature could decide whether
a judge or a jury should apply the recidivism sentencing
enhancement.

															So did Alabama. See Yates v.
State, 245 Ala. 490, 492, 17 So. 2d 777, 779 (1944) (It is
“discretionary with the trial judge whether to impose additional
punishment and to make inquiry into that question in a
supplementary manner in order to apply the increased limits”).

															And Kansas. See State v. Woodman,
127 Kan. 166, 172, 272 P. 132, 134 (1928) (“In this state it is no
concern of the jury” whether a recidivism enhancement applies); see
also Chance v. State, 195 Kan. 711, 715, 
408 P.2d 677, 681 (1965) (“It has never been the rule in
Kansas” that recidivism has to be treated as an element of a crime
(quotation marks omitted)); see also 1868 Kan. Sess. Laws
pp. 380–381 (recidivism enhancement).

															The variation in early American practice
forecloses the argument that the right to have a jury apply
recidivism

															

															

															

															enhancements was traditionally understood as an
inherent part of the Sixth Amendment right to trial by
jury.[5]

															Another common practice in the early 1800s
confirms that legislatures could choose how to handle recidivism
issues. Early state constitutions required the government to
include the elements of an offense in an indictment. See,
e.g., Jones v. Robbins, 74 Mass. 329, 347, 350
(1857). The prosecution also had to prove elements of the offense
beyond a reasonable doubt, as the requirements for an indictment
and a jury trial went hand in hand. Commonwealth v.
McKie, 67 Mass. 61, 62 (1854).

															But many States, including Massachusetts and
Virginia, did not include the facts about past crimes in an
indictment—in other words, did not treat recidivism as an element
of the offense. See 1818 Mass. Acts pp. 603–604; 1819 Va. Acts ch.
171, pp. 619–620; 1824 Me. Laws p. 1009; 1868
W. Va. Acts ch. 165, pp. 733–734. Those States
allowed the government to raise and prove recidivism after the
defendant had been convicted of the present crime. Those States’
practices reflected and reinforced the familiar line between a
conviction for the present offense and a sentencing enhancement
based on past offenses.

															State courts upheld that practice against
constitutional challenges. In 1824, the Massachusetts Supreme
Judicial Court held that even if the recidivism enhancement would
have been included in the original indictment “at common law,” the
“legislature had” the power to change that default rule.
In re Ross, 19 Mass. 165, 171; see also State v.
Graham, 68 W. Va. 248, 251, 69 S.E. 1010, 1011
(1910)

															(The West Virginia recidivism statute “is not
contrary to any constitutional provision”).

															Importantly, this Court upheld that practice as
well. In Graham v. West Virginia, the Court reasoned
that although “the State may properly provide for the allegation of
the former conviction in the indictment,” there was “no
constitutional mandate” to do so. 224 U.S.
616, 629 (1912).

															In short, the historical evidence reveals a
“spectrum of state procedures” for applying recidivism-based
sentence enhancements. Spencer, 385 U. S., at 566.
America has a long tradition of legislative discretion over whether
a judge or jury will apply recidivism sentencing
enhancements.[6]

															The different state approaches did not pop up by
accident. The States had good reason to experiment with different
approaches to recidivism enhancements. Why? Requiring the
Government to present evidence of a defendant’s past crimes to a
jury at trial would undermine the right to trial “by an impartial
jury” that the Sixth Amendment protects.

															As this Court “has long recognized, the
introduction of evidence of a defendant’s prior crimes risks
significant prejudice.” Almendarez-Torres, 523 U. S.,
at 235. That kind of prior-crimes evidence “is said to weigh too
much with the jury and to so overpersuade them as to prejudge one
with a bad general record and deny him a fair opportunity to defend
against a particular charge.” Michelson v. United
States, 335 U.S.
469, 476 (1948). To avoid that problem, American evidence laws
have long restricted the use of prior-crimes evidence. See 1 J.

															Wigmore, Evidence §§193–194, pp. 231–235 (1904);
Fed. Rule Evid. 404(b)(1).

															What good would that longstanding evidence
principle be if the jury always had to apply recidivism
enhancements? The price of having a jury apply recidivism
sentencing enhancements would be the loss of a protection against
prejudicial evidence that itself is deeply entrenched in American
law. To avoid making defendants pay that price, some legislatures
have long given judges the responsibility of applying sentence
enhancements—while reserving to juries the duty to fairly decide
the defendant’s guilt for the present crime. See, e.g.,
Hudson, 32 La., at 1053 (A judge may determine “previous
convictions” because that information “might prejudice the jury”);
Woodman, 127 Kan., at 172, 272 P., at 134–135 (“the jurors’
minds should not be diverted from the question of defendant’s
innocence or guilt by facts concerning defendant’s prior
convictions of other felonies,” and it “is also fairer to defendant
to keep such matters entirely away from the jury”); see also D.
Sidikman, Note, The Pleading and Proof of Prior Convictions in
Habitual Criminal Prosecutions, 33
N. Y. U. L. Rev. 210, 215 (1958) (allowing
judges to apply recidivism enhancements ensures that the “jury
trial as to the charged offense is conducted in a nonprejudicial
atmosphere”). The distinctive tradition that governs recidivism
enhancements for past offenses has traditionally co-existed with
the general right to a jury trial for present offenses.

															To sum up: Since the early 1800s, some
legislatures have entrusted recidivism sentencing findings to
judges, and others have required juries to make those findings.
That variation reflects the many countervailing interests that
legislatures must balance on this issue—including the prejudice
that results from telling a jury about a defendant’s past criminal
behavior. And that unsurprising variation makes clear that
Almendarez-Torres was and remains correct. The Sixth
Amendment allows a judge to determine whether the defendant should
receive a recidivism sentencing enhancement. At a minimum, the
history shows that Almendarez-Torres is not egregiously
wrong.

															B

															Suppose, however, that one thinks that
Almendarez-Torres is wrong, even egregiously wrong. Even
then, the two other stare decisis factors—consequences and
reliance interests—strongly counsel in favor of adhering to
Almendarez-Torres rather than overruling it.

															First, Almendarez-Torres has not
generated the kind of negative real-world or jurisprudential
consequences that would support an overruling. By allowing judges
to apply recidivism enhancements, Almendarez-Torres has
ensured that defendants need not choose between (i) their right to
a jury trial and (ii) their interest in keeping the details of past
crimes from a jury.

															Consider the prejudice that overruling
Almendarez-Torres would cause if a jury had to decide
whether defendants are eligible for every state and federal
recidivism sentencing enhancement. As happened in one recent
federal trial, the jury could hear a prosecutor’s closing argument
begin: “Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, this defendant, a gun
toting, drug slinging three time convicted felon
. . . .” United States v. Harrell, No.
1:22–cr–20245 (SD Fla., Mar. 6, 2023), ECF Doc. 105, p. 33.
The verdict in that case? Guilty.

															Erlinger suggests that trial courts could avoid
putting defendants to the choice between prejudicing the jury and
having to forgo a jury trial by bifurcating the trial. Bifurcating
entails holding a separate mini-trial with the jury on the
recidivism enhancement after the jury has found the defendant
guilty of a crime.

															

															But most criminal cases are tried in state
court. And States remain free not to bifurcate (as do federal
judges, for that matter). Bifurcated trials have been and remain
“rare in our jurisprudence; they have never been compelled by this
Court as a matter of constitutional law, or even as a matter of
federal procedure.” Spencer, 385 U. S., at 568.
Instead, the trial court ordinarily has discretion to decide
whether to bifurcate, and bifurcation carries “its own costs.”
United States v. Durham, 655 F. Supp. 3d 598,
615 (WD Ky. 2023). In order for overruling Almendarez-Torres
to help defendants instead of hurting many of them, this Court
would have to say as a matter of constitutional law that all 50
States and the federal courts must hold bifurcated trials in
recidivism cases. Of course, that would require overruling
Spencer, 385 U. S., at 568–569. I doubt that the Court
would go to that extreme. So if Almendarez-Torres were
overruled, a defendant who is denied a bifurcated trial could be
subject to all of the harm and prejudice that results from telling
a jury about the defendant’s past crimes.[7]

															Erlinger also suggests that, to avoid prejudice,
defendants can stipulate to the relevant facts about their prior
crimes. Brief for Petitioner 41. But that of course makes sense
only in cases where the defendant is not disputing the recidivism
enhancement. Stipulation is obviously not a solution for those
cases where the defendant is contesting his prior convictions and
the recidivism enhancement.

															In any event, it is true that this Court has
interpreted the Federal Rules of Evidence to require the Government
to accept a defendant’s stipulation that he has a prior conviction.
Old Chief v. United States, 519
U.S. 172, 191–192 (1997). But even under the Federal Rules as
interpreted in Old Chief, the jury will still hear the
stipulation—for example, that the defendant admits that he
committed prior felonies.

															And to reiterate, most criminal cases are tried
in state court. This Court’s interpretation of the Federal Rules of
Evidence does not require state courts to follow suit when they
interpret state rules of evidence. See, e.g., State
v. Ball, 99–0428, p. 5 (La. 11/30/99), 756 So. 2d 275, 278
(“We conclude that Old Chief is not controlling and decline
to follow it”); Commonwealth v. Jemison, 626 Pa. 489,
502, 98 A.3d 1254, 1261–1262 (2014).

															Moreover, defendants will suffer that
prejudicial harm for little benefit. Determining whether the
defendant has a prior conviction for a particular offense will
generally yield an obvious answer from the record (or lack
thereof ) of the prior conviction. Important as the judgment
of the jury usually is, I struggle to imagine a jury making a
different (or at least a more accurate) finding than a judge on the
question of whether a defendant was previously convicted of a
crime.[8] As explained above,
this case is a prime example. And even if one could stretch the
imagination far enough to conceive of a case in which sending the
prior-conviction issue to the jury makes a difference and produces
a more accurate answer, it would certainly not be a sufficiently
frequent occurrence to create a pressing need to overrule
precedent.

															Nor has Almendarez-Torres caused any
jurisprudential confusion. Erlinger suggests that the logic of
Apprendi undermines Almendarez-Torres. But
Apprendi itself reconciled the two cases. In ruling the way
that it did on present crimes, Apprendi explained at length
why Almendarez-Torres raised a distinct issue about past
crimes.

															That line—between the present crime and the past
crimes—is clear and has been eminently workable. For sentencing
purposes, a judge can find that a defendant was convicted of past
crimes, including the who, what, when, and where of those crimes.
It is as easy as that. The Apprendi rule and
Almendarez-Torres rule easily co-exist and have for 24 years
co-existed as a matter of Sixth Amendment law. See Apprendi
v. New Jersey, 530 U.S.
466, 487–490 (2000).

															And today’s decision does not alter the basic
ease of applying Almendarez-Torres. Today’s decision,
although I disagree with it, is a clear and easily administered
carveout from Almendarez-Torres.

															Second, as to reliance, the State and
Federal Governments possess substantial reliance interests in their
existing sentencing schemes. “Statutes that punish recidivists more
severely than first offenders have a long tradition in this country
that dates back to colonial times.” Parke, 506 U. S.,
at 26. By 1992, all 50 States and the Federal Government had
recidivism sentencing enhancements. Id., at 26–27. State
judges apply many of those state recidivism sentencing
enhancements, as federal judges do in ACCA. See, e.g.,
N. J. Stat. Ann. §2C:44–3(a) (West 2016); 42 Pa. Cons. Stat.
§9714(a)(2) (2019); R. I. Gen. Laws §12–19–21 (2002).

															Overruling Almendarez-Torres would upend
that settled practice. Legislatures across the country would have
to choose among various bad options. They could undermine the
longstanding limits on introducing evidence at trial of past
crimes. They could jettison longstanding sentencing enhancements
for recidivists. They could mandate costly and inefficient
bifurcated trials in cases with a recidivism enhancement, a fairly
dramatic change to day-to-day criminal trial practice in many
jurisdictions. Or they could simply enact discretionary sentencing
regimes and authorize sentences within a broad range for most
crimes, leaving to judges’ discretion the choice within that range.
See Apprendi, 530 U. S., at 490, n. 16. Any of
those options would be a big change—and on top of that, several
would actually be unhelpful to criminal defendants.

															To what end? There would be little (really
nothing) to gain by overruling Almendarez-Torres now, after
26 years of settled federal and state practice relying on and
easily applying it. It is difficult to conceive of a stronger case
for stare decisis than a longstanding rule with substantial
systemic benefits, ease of application, no apparent downside for
criminal defendants, and significant reliance interests. This Court
should adhere to Almendarez-Torres’s settled rule.

															*  *  *

															As to the Court’s conclusion that a jury must
determine whether the defendant’s three prior violent felonies were
committed on different occasions, I respectfully dissent.

Notes
1
 The other constitutional
cases that the Court cites similarly did not involve recidivism.
See United States v. Haymond, 588 U.S. 634, 645–646
(2019) (plurality opinion) (“additional conduct in violation
of ” the defendant’s supervised release); Cunningham v.
California, 549 U.S.
270, 275 (2007) (facts about the defendant’s “violent conduct”
in committing the charged crime); Blakely v.
Washington, 542 U.S.
296, 298 (2004) (defendant acted with “deliberate cruelty” in
committing the charged crime (quotation marks
omitted)).

 Unlike the Court’s
interpretation of ACCA in cases like Mathis and
Descamps, moreover, the Court’s new constitutional rule will
apply not only to federal cases, but also to state cases. Several
States have recidivism enhancements that require judges to find
whether the defendant committed prior crimes on different
occasions. See, e.g., 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. §9714(a)(2) (2019);
R. I. Gen. Laws §12–19–21 (2002). Those state courts, like the
federal courts, have long relied on Almendarez-Torres to
hold that judges may make that different-occasions determination.
See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Gordon, 596 Pa.
231, 251, and n. 16, 942 A.2d 174, 186, and n. 16 (2007);
State v. Ramirez, 936 A.2d 1254, 1269 (R. I.
2007). Those courts, too, will be surprised by today’s new
rule.
3
 For any case that is
already final, the Teague rule will presumably bar the
defendant from raising today’s new rule in collateral proceedings.
See Edwards v. Vannoy, 593 U.S. 255, 258 (2021);
Teague v. Lane, 489 U.S.
288, 310 (1989) (plurality opinion).

 Going forward, I assume
that the Wooden statement about offenses committed a day or
more apart or at a significant distance will inform the content of
jury instructions.
5
 A different
constitutional rule applies if the defendant’s status as a felon is
an element of the present offense necessary to make the conduct
criminal in the first place, as with the prohibition on possessing
a firearm as a felon. See 18 U. S. C. §922(g)(1);
Rehaif v. United States, 588 U.S. 225, 229–230
(2019). The issue here, by contrast, is the use of past offenses to
enhance the sentence for the present offense of
conviction.
6
 Throughout much of
American history, criminal sentencing at both the state and federal
levels has often been done by judges in systems where the judges
have discretion to sentence within broad ranges. And in those
discretionary-sentencing systems, judges routinely determine the
facts of a defendant’s prior convictions and take account of a
defendant’s criminal record in imposing a sentence within the broad
sentencing range authorized by statute.
7
 If a State does not
provide for bifurcation, a defendant’s only path to avoid the
prejudice from the prosecutor’s parading evidence of the
defendant’s past crimes before the jury may be to seek the best
plea deal possible and plead guilty—hardly a beneficial result for
defendants.
8
 To be clear, in a
recidivism proceeding (whether at trial or sentencing), a defendant
ordinarily cannot challenge the underlying validity of the prior
conviction—for example, by arguing that the prior conviction was
infected by error. See Parke v. Raley, 506 U.S.
20, 29–30 (1992). Challenges to the underlying validity of a
prior conviction typically must be made in the appeal or habeas
corpus proceedings regarding that prior conviction.
