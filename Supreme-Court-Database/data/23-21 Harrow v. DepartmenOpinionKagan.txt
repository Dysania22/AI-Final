															STUART R. HARROW, PETITIONER v.
DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE

															on writ of certiorari to the united states
court of appeals for the federal circuit

															[May 16, 2024]

															

															Justice Kagan delivered the opinion of the
Court.

															A federal employee subjected to an adverse
personnel action may complain to the Merit Systems Protection
Board. If the Board rules against him, he may appeal to the Court
of Appeals for the Federal Circuit “within 60 days.” 5
U. S. C. §7703(b)(1). The question presented is whether
that 60-day limit is “jurisdictional,” and therefore precludes
equitable exceptions. We hold that the limit, like most filing
deadlines, is not jurisdictional.

															I

															This case began in 2013, when Stuart Harrow, a
longtime employee of the Department of Defense, filed a claim with
the Merit Systems Protection Board objecting to a six-day furlough.
The Board is an independent agency established to adjudicate
federal employment disputes. It referred the case, as is usual, to
an administrative judge for an initial decision. In 2016, the judge
upheld the furlough, finding it “regrettable” but not “improper.”
No. 22–2254 (CA Fed.), ECF Doc. 6, p. 19. Harrow sought review of
that conclusion before the full Board, as the law allows. But in
early 2017—with Harrow’s action still pending—the Board lost its
quorum, and so its ability to resolve cases. That state of affairs
lasted for over five years. It was not until May 2022 that the
Board, with a quorum finally restored, affirmed the administrative
judge’s decision.

															That long delay led Harrow to miss his next
deadline. Under 5 U. S. C. §7703(b)(1), Harrow was
supposed to petition for review in the Federal Circuit “within 60
days” of the Board’s final order. See ibid. (stating that
the petition “shall be filed” within that time). But Harrow did not
submit his petition until September 2022—more than 120 days after
the Board’s order issued. In an associated filing, Harrow offered
an excuse for his lateness. During his years-long wait for the
Board’s decision, Harrow explained, his work email address had
changed—and the old address at some point stopped forwarding to the
new one. See ECF Doc. 8, at 7–8. So when the Board sent notice of
its order to the email address it had on file, Harrow never got the
message. He learned of the decision only from a search he did of
the Board’s website, after the 60-day period had run. Given the
“extenuating circumstances,” Harrow urged, the Federal Circuit
should overlook his petition’s untimeliness. Id., at 7.

															The Court of Appeals declined Harrow’s request
for equitable consideration, believing it had an absolute
obligation to dismiss his appeal. The court reasoned that the
60-day statutory deadline is a “jurisdictional requirement,” and
therefore “not subject to equitable tolling.” App. to Pet. for
Cert. 2a. “Harrow’s situation” might be “sympathetic,” the court
stated, but it was also irrelevant. Ibid. Given the
deadline’s jurisdictional nature, the court lacked the capacity to
“excuse a failure to timely file based on individual
circumstances.” Ibid.

															We granted certiorari to decide whether, as the
Federal Circuit held, the 60-day deadline to appeal a Board
decision is jurisdictional. 601 U. S. ___ (2023). We hold it
is not.

															II

															The procedural requirements that Congress
enacts to govern the litigation process are only occasionally as
strict as they seem. Most of those rules read as categorical
commands (e.g., a person “shall file in this court,” “shall
file by that time,” “shall include the following documents”). But
Congress legislates against the backdrop of judicial doctrines
creating exceptions, and typically expects those doctrines to
apply. See Minerva Surgical, Inc. v. Hologic, Inc.,
594 U.S. 559, 571–572 (2021). So a court will not enforce a
procedural rule against a non-complying party if his opponent has
forfeited or waived an objection. And more relevant here, a court
may be able to excuse the party’s non-compliance for equitable
reasons. See infra, at 9. Except—and this “except” is
important—in a small set of cases, where the procedural rule counts
as “jurisdictional.” When Congress enacts a jurisdictional
requirement, it “mark[s] the bounds” of a court’s power: A
litigant’s failure to follow the rule “deprives a court of all
authority to hear a case.” Boechler v. Commissioner,
596 U.S. 199, 203 (2022); United States v. Kwai Fun
Wong, 575 U.S.
402, 409 (2015). So a court must enforce the rule even if no
party has raised it. And a court must adhere to the rule “even if
equitable considerations would support” excusing its violation.
Id., at 409.

															Mindful of those repercussions, this Court will
“treat a procedural requirement as jurisdictional only if Congress
‘clearly states’ that it is.” Boechler, 596 U. S., at
203 (quoting Arbaugh v. Y & H Corp., 546 U.S.
500, 515 (2006)). Congress of course need not use “magic words”
to convey that such a requirement confines a court’s authority. 596
U. S., at 203. But our demand for a clear statement erects a
“high bar.” Kwai Fun Wong, 575 U. S., at 409. For a
procedural rule to surmount it, “traditional tools of statutory
construction must plainly show that Congress imbued [the rule] with
jurisdictional consequences.” Id., at 410.

															And under that approach, “most time bars are
nonjurisdictional.” Ibid.; see Sebelius v. Auburn
Regional Medical Center, 568 U.S.
145, 154–155 (2013) (citing cases). That is true whether or not
the bar is “framed in mandatory terms.” Kwai Fun Wong, 575
U. S., at 410. Consider a provision closely resembling the one
here: A veteran denied benefits by an agency “shall file a notice
of appeal with the Court [of Appeals for Veterans Claims] within
120 days.” 38 U. S. C. §7266(a). We viewed the provision
as a run-of-the-mill “filing deadline,” seeking “to promote the
orderly progress of litigation” rather than to demarcate a court’s
power. Henderson v. Shinseki, 562
U.S. 428, 435 (2011). The time bar, we explained, “does not
speak in jurisdictional terms or refer in any way to the
jurisdiction of the Veterans Court.” Id., at 438
(alterations omitted). And we made the same point when discussing a
statute of limitations whose phrasing was even more “emphatic.”
Kwai Fun Wong, 575 U. S., at 411. A “tort claim against
the United States shall be forever barred,” that provision
pronounced, unless presented “within two years.” 28
U. S. C. §2401(b). Once again, we saw no sign that
Congress meant to give the time bar jurisdictional consequence. The
provision, we reasoned, “does not define a federal court’s
jurisdiction over tort claims generally, address its authority to
hear untimely suits, or in any way cabin its usual equitable
powers.” Kwai Fun Wong, 575 U. S., at 411. The time
limit was “just [a] time limit[ ], nothing more.” Id.,
at 412.

															No language in the time-bar provision Harrow
violated suggests a different result. Section 7703(b)(1) states, as
relevant here:

															“[A] petition to review a final order or
final decision of the Board shall be filed in the United States
Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. Notwithstanding any other
provision of law, any petition for review shall be filed within 60
days after the Board issues notice of the final order or decision
of the Board.”

															The provision thus describes how a litigant can
obtain judicial review of the Board’s final orders. It directs
those appeals—including Harrow’s—to the Federal Circuit. And it
sets a deadline: 60 days from when the Board’s order issues. That
deadline is stated in mandatory terms—“shall be filed.” But as we
have repeatedly held, that fact is “of no consequence” to the
jurisdictional issue. Kwai Fun Wong, 575 U. S., at 411;
see Henderson, 562 U. S., at 439. “What matters
instead” is whether a time bar speaks to a court’s authority to
hear a case. Kwai Fun Wong, 575 U. S., at 411. And
nothing in §7703(b)(1) does: There is no mention of the Federal
Circuit’s jurisdiction, whether generally or over untimely claims.
So §7703(b)(1), on its own, does not deprive the Federal Circuit of
power to hear Harrow’s appeal. Not even the Government, which
defends the view that the 60-day limit is jurisdictional, argues
otherwise.

															The Government instead rests its case on part of
a different statute— 28 U. S. C. §1295, which spells out
the Federal Circuit’s subject-matter jurisdiction. That law lists
14 categories of cases the court has power to decide. The one
relevant here is the ninth. Section 1295(a)(9) grants the Federal
Circuit jurisdiction “of an appeal from a final order or final
decision of the Merit Systems Protection Board, pursuant to
section[ ] 7703(b)(1).” In the Government’s view, the term
“pursuant to” means—indeed, can only mean—in “conformance to” or
“compliance with.” Brief for United States 11; see id., at
38. So (the Government argues) only appeals fully complying with
§7703(b)(1)—including its 60-day deadline—fall within the Federal
Circuit’s jurisdiction. In that way, the time limit becomes a
“jurisdictional prerequisite.” Id., at 11.

															But the Government’s reading of §1295(a)(9) is
more strained than clear. “Pursuant to” is one of those little
phrases that can mean a raft of things. See B. Garner, Dictionary
of Legal Usage 737 (3d ed. 2011) (“Because the phrase means so many
things, it is rarely—if ever—useful”). Maybe sometimes, as the
Government urges, it conveys that one thing is in strict compliance
with another. But that is not the only—or even the most
common—meaning when a legal drafter writes that some filing has
been made “pursuant to” a statutory provision. Then the phrase
often functions as a legalese synonym for “under.” See ibid.
It identifies the provision that served as the basis for the
filing, but without addressing whether the latter conformed to the
former’s every requirement. Consider two of our own opinions. In
one, we stated that a law gave whistleblower protection to
employees of companies that “file [certain statements] pursuant to
§15(d),” even as we observed that the employees might be “reporting
violations” of that section’s commands. Lawson v. FMR
LLC, 571 U.S.
429, 446 (2014). And similarly in another, we noted that a
person had “filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in
[district court] pursuant to” 28 U. S. C. §2254, only to
hold three paragraphs later that he actually “could not satisfy”
one of §2254’s requirements. Alaska v. Wright, 593
U.S. 152, 153–154 (2021) (per curiam). In like manner,
we today could say that Harrow filed his appeal “pursuant to”
§7703(b)(1) even though he failed to satisfy that section’s time
bar.

															And more to the point, we think Congress would
agree with that usage. Consider a different law it drafted about
appellate review, which this Court recently examined. See BP
p.l.c. v. Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, 593 U.S.
230, 237–239 (2021). The provision is part of the statutory scheme
for removing cases from state to federal court. Under that scheme,
a defendant may remove a case by invoking any of several statutory
grounds; but the federal court must remand the case to state court
if it finds that the ground does not apply. See 28
U. S. C. §§1441–1444, 1446(a), 1447(c). For the most
part, a remand order is not appealable. But that rule has an
exception: An appeal is allowed when the federal court remands a
case that was previously “removed pursuant to section 1442 or 1443”
(which state two specific grounds for removal). §1447(d). What does
that “pursuant to” mean? It cannot mean that a party may appeal
only when his removal actually conformed to §1442 or §1443 (as the
Government’s argument here would imply). Whether the removal did so
is the very question the appeal will decide. Instead, as we
explained in BP p.l.c., to remove a case “pursuant to” §1442
or §1443 “just means” that the defendant must have “assert[ed] the
case is removable” under one of those provisions. 593 U. S.,
at 238. In similar vein, to file an appeal from a Board’s order
“pursuant to” §7703(b)(1) likely just means to invoke that section
as the basis for the appeal, rather than to comply with its
associated time limit. At the least, there is no clarity the other
way. Section 1295(a)(9)’s use of the words “pursuant to” does not
“plainly show” that §7703(b)(1)’s deadline has “jurisdictional
consequences.” Kwai Fun Wong, 575 U. S., at 410.

															The rest of §1295 confirms that conclusion. In
listing the cases over which the Federal Circuit has jurisdiction,
that provision uses the term “pursuant to” several more times. In
particular, the Circuit can hear appeals from an agency decision
“pursuant to” a statute about public contracts, and from a district
court decision made “pursuant to” certain patent statutes.
§1295(a)(4)(C), (10). The referenced laws in turn contain a bevy of
procedural rules—not only setting deadlines (as in §7703(b)(1)),
but also requiring service and other forms of notification,
mandating prior government authorization of certain matters, and
even compelling the payment of expenses. See 35 U. S. C.
§§145, 146; 41 U. S. C. §7107(a)(1)(B). Assuming the
phrase “pursuant to” has the same meaning throughout §1295—and why
should it not?—all those requirements, too, would become
jurisdictional. That result is untenable. We have almost never
treated the sort of routine rules swept up in the Government’s
“pursuant to” reading as absolute bars to judicial action, neither
subject to forfeiture nor excusable for equitable reasons. See
supra, at 3–4. So the wider implications of the Government’s
argument serve to defeat it (were any doubt left). The jumble of
procedural rules to which §1295 points cannot turn on and off the
Federal Circuit’s power.

															The Government identifies one kind of time limit
that counts as jurisdictional, but we have already made plain its
exceptional nature. As the Government notes, the Court held in
Bowles v. Russell, 551 U.S.
205 (2007), that the deadline for filing an appeal from a
district court’s decision in a civil case is jurisdictional, even
though the statute setting that limit does not say as much. See
Brief for United States 24. In that decision, we reaffirmed a line
of precedents pre-dating our current approach to such matters. See
551 U. S., at 209–210, and n. 2. But we have since taken
care to delineate both where Bowles applies and where it
does not. Bowles governs statutory deadlines to appeal “from
one Article III court to another.” Hamer v. Neighborhood
Housing Servs. of Chicago, 583 U.S. 17, 25 (2017). As to all
other time bars, we now demand a “clear statement.” Id., at
25, n. 9. This case falls outside the Bowles exception
because Harrow appealed to the Federal Circuit not from another
court but from an agency. And as we have shown, the time limit
Harrow missed when he filed that appeal does not satisfy our
clear-statement test. See supra, at 4–8.[1]

															Having thus held that §7703(b)(1)’s deadline is
non-jurisdictional, we encounter a newly raised back-up argument.
Even if non-jurisdictional, the Government urges, the 60-day limit
“would still not be subject to equitable tolling.” Brief for United
States 42. In making that claim, the Government must contend with
another high bar. “Because we do not understand Congress to alter”
age-old procedural doctrines lightly, “nonjurisdictional [timing
rules] are presumptively subject to equitable tolling.”
Boechler, 596 U. S., at 209; see supra, at 3.
The Government says it can rebut that presumption, but we are not
the right court to now determine whether that is so. The Government
did not broach the issue below; the Federal Circuit did not address
it; and it is not included in the question presented. We therefore
leave the matter (including any waiver issues involved) to the
Federal Circuit on remand. And if that court finds equitable
tolling available, it should decide whether, on the facts here,
Harrow is entitled to that relief.

															For the reasons stated, we vacate the judgment
of the Court of Appeals and remand the case for further proceedings
consistent with this opinion.

															It is so ordered.

Notes
1
 The Government also
invokes Lindahl v. Office of Personnel Management,
470 U.S.
768 (1985), in support of its position, but that decision helps
it no more than Bowles. In Lindahl, the Court held
that the Federal Circuit has jurisdiction over Board decisions
denying disability retirement claims. See 470 U. S., at 799.
In doing so, we referred to not only §1295 but also §7703(b)(1) as
“jurisdictional.” Id., at 792–793. But that is just one more
example (our recent decisions have offered many) of how this Court
used to apply the term “jurisdiction” in a “profligate” manner,
failing to distinguish between statutes spelling out a court’s
power and those specifying what steps litigants should take.
Arbaugh v. Y & H Corp., 546
U.S. 500, 510 (2006); see Kontrick v. Ryan,
540 U.S.
443, 454–455 (2004). And in any event, Lindahl concerned
only the scope of claims that may be brought to the Federal
Circuit; it had nothing to do with time limits—which, we repeat,
are generally non-jurisdictional. See United States v.
Kwai Fun Wong, 575 U.S.
402, 410 (2015); supra, at 4.
