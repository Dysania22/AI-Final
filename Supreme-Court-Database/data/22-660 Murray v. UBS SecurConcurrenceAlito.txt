															SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

															_________________

															No. 22–660

															_________________

															TREVOR MURRAY, PETITIONER v. UBS
SECURITIES, LLC, et al.

															on writ of certiorari to the united states
court of appeals for the second circuit

															[February 8, 2024]

															

															Justice Alito, with whom Justice Barrett
joins, concurring.

															I agree with the Court that a plaintiff suing
under the whistleblower-protection provision of the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act need not prove that his or her employer acted with “animus,” a
term that denotes “prejudic[e]” or “ill will.”[1] Merriam-Webster’s Collegiate Dictionary 46
(10th ed. 1996); American Heritage Dictionary 73 (3d ed. 1992). The
statute makes no mention of “animus” or any of its synonyms, and we
have no ground for adding it in as an additional, non-statutory
requirement. I write separately to explain in simple terms how the
statute works and to reiterate that our rejection of an “animus”
requirement does not read intent out of the statute. Rather, as the
Court confirms, a plaintiff must still show intent to discriminate.
Ante, at 9.

															A Sarbanes-Oxley plaintiff must ultimately prove
that his or her employer “discharge[d], demote[d], suspend[ed],
threaten[ed], harass[ed], or in any other manner discriminate[d]
against” him or her “because of ” protected whistleblowing. 18
U. S. C. §1514A(a). The phrase “in any other manner
discriminate” suggests that the adverse action—here, petitioner’s
discharge—must be a form of discrimination. Cf.
Massachusetts v. EPA, 549 U.S.
497, 557 (2007) (Scalia, J., dissenting) (noting that when a
catchall phrase is “limited,” the other items in the list “must be
viewed . . . in light of that category”). And a
discriminatory discharge that is made “because of ” a
particular factor necessarily involves an intentional choice in
which that factor plays some role in the employer’s thinking. As
the Court puts it, the plaintiff must prove that the employer
“ ‘intentionally treat[ed the plaintiff] worse because
of ’ ” the protected conduct. Ante, at 9 (quoting
Bostock v. Clayton County, 590 U.S. 644, 658
(2020)).

															To structure the presentation of proof in a case
brought under the whistleblower-protection provision,
Sarbanes-Oxley adopts a burden-shifting framework. See 18
U. S. C. §1514A(b)(2)(C); 49 U. S. C.
§42121(b)(2)(B). This framework provides the “mechanism for getting
at” discriminatory intent. Ante, at 11. Under this
framework, the plaintiff must show that differential treatment was
at least in part “because of” his or her protected conduct,
§1514A(a), and was thus a “contributing factor” in the employer’s
decision-making process. §42121(b)(2)(B)(iii). This requires proof
of intent; that is, the plaintiff must show that a reason
for the adverse decision was the employee’s protected conduct. The
plaintiff need not prove that the protected conduct was the only
reason or even that it was a principal reason for the adverse
decision. Showing that it “help[ed] to cause or bring about” that
decision is enough. Concise Oxford Dictionary 310 (10th ed. 1999);
Webster’s Third New International Dictionary 496 (1993) (defining
“contributing” as “ha[ving] a part in producing an effect”).

															If the plaintiff makes that showing, the
statute’s intent requirement is met, and the only open question is
causation. On that element, the burden shifts to the employer to
prove “by clear and convincing evidence that [it] would have taken
the same unfavorable personnel action” alleged in the complaint.
§42121(b)(2)(B)(iv). In other words, it must show that the
plaintiff ’s protected conduct did not cause the challenged
employment decision. And if the employer satisfies that burden, the
element of causation has not been proved.

															On the understanding that this is the
interpretation adopted today, I join the opinion of the Court.

Notes
1
 The Court uses the term
“retaliatory intent” as a synonym for “animus.” See ante, at
8. All references in the opinion to “retaliatory intent” must be
understood to carry that meaning.
