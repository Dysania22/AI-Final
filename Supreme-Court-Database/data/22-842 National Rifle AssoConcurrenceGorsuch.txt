															SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

															_________________

															No. 22–842

															_________________

															NATIONAL RIFLE ASSOCIATION OF AMERICA,
PETITIONER v. MARIA T. VULLO

															on writ of certiorari to the united states
court of appeals for the second circuit

															[May 30, 2024]

															

															Justice Gorsuch, concurring.

															I write separately to explain my understanding
of the Court’s opinion, which I join in full. Today we reaffirm a
well-settled principle: “A government official cannot coerce a
private party to punish or suppress disfavored speech on her
behalf.” Ante, at 11. As the Court mentions, many lower
courts have taken to analyzing this kind of coercion claim under a
four-pronged “multifactor test.” Ibid. These tests, the
Court explains, might serve “as a useful, though nonexhaustive,
guide.” Ante, at 12. But sometimes they might not. Cf.
Axon Enterprise, Inc. v. FTC, 598 U.S. 175, 205–207
(2023) (Gorsuch, J., concurring in judgment). Indeed, the Second
Circuit’s decision to break up its analysis into discrete parts and
“tak[e] the [complaint’s] allegations in isolation” appears only to
have contributed to its mistaken conclusion that the National Rifle
Association failed to state a claim. Ante, at 15. Lower
courts would therefore do well to heed this Court’s directive:
Whatever value these “guideposts” serve, they remain “just” that
and nothing more. Ante, at 12. “Ultimately, the critical”
question is whether the plaintiff has “plausibly allege[d] conduct
that, viewed in context, could be reasonably understood to convey a
threat of adverse government action in order to punish or suppress
the plaintiff ’s speech.” Ante, at 12, 19.
