															Justice Gorsuch delivered the opinion of the
Court.

															The Clean Air Act envisions States and the
federal government working together to improve air quality. Under
that law’s terms, States bear “primary responsibility” for
developing plans to achieve air-quality goals. 42
U. S. C. §7401(a)(3). Should a State fail to prepare a
legally compliant plan, however, the federal government may
sometimes step in and assume that authority for itself.
§7410(c)(1). Here, the federal government announced its intention
to reject over 20 States’ plans for controlling ozone pollution. In
their place, the government sought to impose a single, uniform
federal plan. This litigation concerns whether, in adopting that
plan, the federal government complied with the terms of the
Act.

															I

															A

															“The Clean Air Act regulates air quality
through a federal-state collaboration.” EME Homer City
Generation, L.P. v. EPA, 795 F.3d 118, 124 (CADC 2015).
Periodically, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) sets
standards for common air pollutants, as necessary to “protect the
public health.” §§7409(a)(1), (b)(1). Once EPA sets a new standard,
the clock starts ticking: States have three years to design and
submit a plan—called a State Implementation Plan, or SIP—providing
for the “implementation, maintenance, and enforcement” of that
standard in their jurisdictions. §7410(a)(1); see EPA v.
EME Homer City Generation, L. P., 572
U.S. 489, 498 (2014). Under the Act, States decide how to
measure ambient air quality. §7410(a)(2)(B). States pick “emission
limitations and other control measures.” §7410(a)(2)(A). And States
provide for the enforcement of their prescribed measures.
§7410(a)(2)(C).

															At the same time, States must design these plans
with their neighbors in mind. Because air currents can carry
pollution across state borders, emissions in upwind States
sometimes affect air quality in downwind States. See EME
Homer, 572 U. S., at 496. To address that externality
problem, under the Act’s “Good Neighbor Provision,” state plans
must prohibit emissions “in amounts which will . . .
contribute significantly to nonattainment in, or interfere with
maintenance by, any other State” of the relevant air-quality
standard. §7410(a)(2)(D)(i)(I).

															Because the States bear “primary responsibility”
for developing compliance plans, §7401(a)(3), EPA has “no authority
to question the wisdom of a State’s choices of emission
limitations.” Train v. Natural Resources Defense Council,
Inc., 421 U.S.
60, 79 (1975). So long as a SIP satisfies the “applicable
requirements” of the Act, including the Good Neighbor Provision,
EPA “shall approve” it within 18 months of its submission.
§7410(k)(3); see §§7410(k)(1)(B), (k)(2). If, however, a SIP falls
short, EPA “shall” issue a Federal Implementation Plan, or FIP, for
the noncompliant State—that is, “unless” the State corrects the
deficiencies in its SIP first. §7410(c)(1); EME Homer, 572
U. S., at 498. EPA must also ensure States meet the new
air-quality standard by a statutory deadline. See §7511.

															B

															A layer of ozone in the atmosphere shields the
world from the sun’s radiation. See National Resources Defense
Council v. EPA, 
464 F.3d 1, 3 (CADC 2006). But closer to earth, ozone can hurt
more than it helps. Forming when sunlight interacts with a wide
range of precursor pollutants, ground-level ozone can trigger and
exacerbate health problems and damage vegetation. 80 Fed. Reg.
65299, 65302, 65370 (2015).

															To mitigate those and other problems, in 2015
EPA revised its air-quality standards for ozone from 75 to 70 parts
per billion. Id., at 65293–65294. That change triggered a
requirement for States to submit new SIPs. Id., at 65437.
Along the way, EPA issued a guidance document advising States that
they had “flexibility” in choosing how to address their Good
Neighbor obligations. See EPA, Memorandum, Information on the
Interstate Transport State Implementation Plan Submissions for the
2015 Ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standards 3 (Mar. 27,
2018). With that and other guidance in hand, many (though not all)
States submitted SIPs. See 84 Fed. Reg. 66612 (2019). And many of
the States that did submit SIPs said that they need not adopt
emissions-control measures to comply with the Good Neighbor
Provision because, among other things, they were not linked to
downwind air-quality problems or they could identify no additional
cost-effective methods of controlling the emissions beyond those
they were currently employing. See, e.g., 87 Fed.
Reg. 9798, 9810 (2022); 87 Fed. Reg. 9545, 9552 (2022); see
generally 88 Fed. Reg. 9336, 9354–9361 (2023).

															For over two years, EPA did not act on the SIPs
it received. See, e.g., 87 Fed. Reg. 9838, 9845–9851
(2022). Then, in February 2022, the agency announced its intention
to disapprove 19 of them on the ground that the States submitting
them had failed to address adequately their obligations under the
Good Neighbor Provision.[1] A
few months later, the agency proposed disapproving four more
SIPs.[2] Pursuant to the Act,
the agency issued its proposed SIP disapprovals for public comment
before finalizing them. See §7607(d)(3).

															C

															During that public comment period, the agency
proposed a single FIP to bind all 23 States.[3] 87 Fed. Reg. 20036, 20038 (2022). Rather than
continue to encourage “ ‘flexibilit[y]’ ” and different
state approaches, EPA now apparently took the view that
“[e]ffective policy solutions to the problem of interstate ozone
transport” demanded that kind of “uniform framework” and
“[n]ationwide consistency.” 87 Fed. Reg. 9841; see 87 Fed. Reg.
20073. The FIP the agency proposed set as its target the reduction
of the emissions of one ozone precursor in particular: nitrous
oxide. See id., at 20038. And it sought to impose nitrous
oxide emissions-control measures that “maximized
cost-effectiveness” in achieving “downwind ozone air quality
improvements.” Id., at 20055; see also id., at
20043.

															In broad strokes, here is how EPA’s proposed
rule worked to eliminate a State’s “significant contribution” to
downwind ozone problems. First, the agency identified various
emissions-control measures and, using nationwide data, calculated
how much each typically costs to reduce a ton of nitrous-oxide
emissions. Id., at 20076; see, e.g.,
id., at 20077–20081. Next, the agency sought to predict how
much each upwind State’s nitrous-oxide emissions would fall if
emissions-producing facilities in the State adopted each measure.
Id., at 20076; see, e.g., id., at 20088–20089;
EPA, Ozone Transport Policy Analysis Proposed Rule TSD 22–23
(EPA–HQ–OAR–2021–0668, 2022) (Proposed Ozone Analysis). In making
those predictions, EPA often considered data specific to the
emissions-producing facilities in the State, and fed “unit-level
and state-level” values into its calculations. See id., at
9–10, 13. Then, the agency estimated how much, on average, ozone
levels would fall in downwind States with the adoption of each
measure. 87 Fed. Reg. 20076; see, e.g., id.,
at 20092–20093, 20096–20097; Proposed Ozone Analysis 51–52. In
making those estimations, too, EPA calibrated its modeling to each
State’s features, “determin[ing] the relationship between changes
in emissions and changes in ozone contributions on a state-by-state
. . . basis.” Id., at 33; see also id., at
40, 42.

															To pick which measures would “maximiz[e] cost-
effectiveness” in achieving “downwind ozone air quality
improvements,” 87 Fed. Reg. 20055, EPA focused on what it called
the “ ‘knee in the curve,’ ” or the point at which more
expenditures in the upwind States were likely to produce “very
little” in the way of “additional emissions reductions and air
quality improvement” downwind, id., at 20095 (hyphenation
omitted). EPA used this point to select a “uniform level” of cost,
and so a uniform package of emissions-reduction tools, for upwind
States to adopt. Id., at 20076. And EPA performed this
analysis on two “parallel tracks”—one for power plants, one for
other industries. Ibid. Pursuant to the Clean Air Act,
§§7607(d)(1)(B), (d)(3)–(6), the agency published its proposed FIP
for notice and comment in April 2022, 87 Fed. Reg. 20036.

															Immediately, commenters warned of a potential
pitfall in the agency’s approach. EPA had determined which
emissions-control measures were cost effective at addressing
downwind ozone levels based on an assumption that the FIP would
apply to all covered States. But what happens if some or many of
those States are not covered? As the commenters portrayed the SIPs,
this was not an entirely speculative possibility. Many believed
EPA’s disapprovals of the SIPs were legally flawed. See,
e.g., Comments of Missouri Dept. of Natural Resources 3
(June 17, 2022) (referencing “all the technical, legal, and
procedural issues” with the proposed SIP disapproval); see also,
e.g., Comments of Louisiana Dept. of Environmental
Quality 1–3 (June 21, 2022); Comments of Texas Comm’n on
Environmental Quality 2–4 (June 21, 2022); EPA, Response to Public
Comments on Proposed Rule 9–11 (EPA–HQ–OAR–2021–0668). They added
that EPA’s FIP was “inextricably linked” to the SIP disapprovals.
E.g., Comments of Missouri Dept. of Natural
Resources, at 4. Without a SIP disapproval or missing SIP, after
all, EPA could not include a State in its FIP. See,
e.g., id., at 3; supra, at 3.

															Commenters added that failing to include a State
could have consequences for the proposed FIP. If the FIP did not
wind up applying to all 23 States as EPA envisioned, commenters
argued, the agency would need “to conduct a new assessment and
modeling of contribution and subject those findings to public
comment.” E.g., Comments of Air Stewardship Coalition
13–14 (June 21, 2022); Comments of Portland Cement Association 7
(June 21, 2022). Why? As noted above, EPA assessed “significant
contribution” by determining what measures in upwind States would
maximize cost-effective ozone-level improvements in the States
downwind of them. Supra, at 5–6. And a different set of
States might mean that the “knee in the curve” would shift. After
all, each State differs in its mix of industries, in its pre-
existing emissions-control measures, and in the impact those
measures may have on emissions and downwind air quality. See 87
Fed. Reg. 20052, 20060, 20071–20073; EPA, Technical Memorandum,
Screening Assessment of Potential Emissions Reductions, Air Quality
Impacts, and Costs from Non-EGU Emissions Units for 2026, pp. 12–13
(2022).[4]

															As it happened, ongoing litigation over the SIP
disap-

															provals soon seemed to vindicate at least some
of the commenters’ concerns. Two circuits issued stays of EPA’s SIP
denials for four States. See Order in No. 23–60069 (CA5, May 1,
2023) (Texas and Louisiana); Order in No. 23–1320 (CA8, May 25,
2023) (Arkansas); Order in No. 23–1719 (CA8, May 26, 2023)
(Missouri).

															Despite those comments and developments, the
agency proceeded to issue its final FIP. 88 Fed. Reg. 36654
(2023).[5] In response to the
problem commenters raised, EPA adopted a severability provision
stating that, should any jurisdiction drop out, its rule would
“continue to be implemented as to any remaining jurisdictions.”
Id., at 36693. But in doing so, EPA did not address whether
or why the same emissions-control measures it mandated would
continue to further the FIP’s stated purpose of maximizing
cost-effective air-quality improvement if fewer States remained in
the plan.

															D

															After EPA issued its final FIP, litigation
over the agency’s SIP disapprovals continued. One court after
another issued one stay after another.[6] Each new stay meant another

															State to which EPA could not apply its FIP.
See §7410(c)(1). Ultimately, EPA recognized that it could not apply
its FIP to 12 of the 23 original States.[7] Together, these 12 States accounted for over 70
percent of the emissions EPA had planned to address through its
FIP. See Application for Ohio et al. in No. 23A349, p. 1
(States’ Application); see also 88 Fed. Reg. 36738–36739.[8]

															A number of the remaining States and industry
groups challenged the remnants of the FIP in the D. C.
Circuit. They pointed to the Act’s provisions authorizing a court
to “reverse any . . . action” taken in connection with a
FIP that is “arbitrary” or “capricious.” §7607(d)(9)(A). And they
argued that EPA’s decision to apply the FIP to them even after so
many other States had dropped out met that standard. As part of
their challenge, they asked that court to stay any effort to
enforce the FIP against them while their appeal unfolded. After
that court denied relief, the applicants renewed their request
here. The Court has received and reviewed over 400 pages of
briefing and a voluminous record, held over an hour of oral
argument on the applications, and engaged in months of postargument
deliberations as we often do for the cases we hear.

															II

															A

															Stay applications are nothing new. They seek a
form of interim relief perhaps “as old as the judicial system of
the nation.” Scripps-Howard Radio, Inc. v. FCC,
316 U.S.
4, 17 (1942). Like any other federal court faced with a stay
request, we must provide the applicants with an answer—“grant or
deny.” Labrador v. Poe, 601 U. S. ___, ___
(2024) (Kavanaugh, J., concurring in grant of stay) (slip op., at
2).

															In deciding whether to issue a stay, we apply
the same “sound . . . principles” as other federal
courts. Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S.
418, 434 (2009) (internal quotation marks omitted).
Specifically, in this litigation, we ask (1) whether the applicant
is likely to succeed on the merits, (2) whether it will suffer
irreparable injury without a stay, (3) whether the stay will
substantially injure the other parties interested in the
proceedings, and (4) where the public interest lies. Ibid.;
States’ Application 13; Response in Opposition for Respondent EPA
in No. 23A349 etc., p. 16 (EPA Response).[9]

															When States and other parties seek to stay the
enforcement of a federal regulation against them, often “the harms
and equities [will be] very weighty on both sides.”
Labrador, 601 U. S., at ___ (opinion of Kavanaugh, J.)
(slip op., at 3). That is certainly the case here, for both sides
have strong arguments with respect to the latter three Nken
factors. On one side of the ledger, the federal government points
to the air-quality benefits its FIP offers downwind States. EPA
Response 48–50. On the other side, the States observe that a FIP
issued unlawfully (as they contend this one was) necessarily
impairs their sovereign interests in regulating their own
industries and citizens—interests the Act expressly recognizes. See
Part I–A, supra; States’ Application 24–26; Maryland
v. King, 567 U.S. 1301, 1303 (2012) (Roberts, C. J., in
chambers). The States observe, too, that having to comply with the
FIP during the pendency of this litigation risks placing them at a
“competitive disadvantage” to their exempt peers. States’
Application 21. The States and the private applicants also stress
that complying with the FIP during the pendency of this litigation
would require them to incur “hundreds of millions[,] if not
billions of dollars.” Tr. of Oral Arg. 96. Those costs, the
applicants note, are “nonrecoverable.” Thunder Basin Coal
Co. v. Reich, 510 U.S.
200, 220–221 (1994) (Scalia, J., concurring in part and
concurring in judgment); see, e.g., States’
Application 24; Application for American Forest & Paper
Association et al. 25; see also Alabama Assn. of
Realtors v. Department of Health and Human Servs., 594
U.S. 758, 765 (2021) (per curiam).

															Because each side has strong arguments about the
harms they face and equities involved, our resolution of these stay
requests ultimately turns on the merits and the question who is
likely to prevail at the end of this litigation. See Nken,
556 U. S., at 434; Labrador, 601 U. S., at ___
(opinion of Kavanaugh, J.) (slip op., at 4).

															B

															When it comes to that question, the parties
agree on the rules that guide our analysis. The applicants argue
that a court is likely to hold EPA’s final FIP “arbitrary” or
“capricious” within the meaning of the Act and thus enjoin its
enforcement against them. 42 U. S. C. §7607(d)(9)(A);
see, e.g., States’ Application 15–16; Application for
American Forest & Paper Association et al. 14; see also 5
U. S. C. §706(2)(A). An agency action qualifies as
“arbitrary” or “capricious” if it is not “reasonable and reasonably
explained.” FCC v. Prometheus Radio Project, 592 U.S.
414, 423 (2021). In reviewing an agency’s action under that
standard, a court may not “ ‘substitute its judgment for that
of the agency.’ ” FCC v. Fox Television Stations,
Inc., 556 U.S.
502, 513 (2009). But it must ensure, among other things, that
the agency has offered “a satisfactory explanation for its
action[,] including a rational connection between the facts found
and the choice made.” Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Assn. of United
States, Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Automobile Ins. Co.,
463 U.S.
29, 43 (1983) (internal quotation marks omitted). Accordingly,
an agency cannot simply ignore “an important aspect of the
problem.” Ibid.

															We agree with the applicants that EPA’s final
FIP likely runs afoul of these long-settled standards. The problem
stems from the way EPA chose to determine which emissions
“contribute[d] significantly” to downwind States’ difficulty
meeting national ozone standards. 42 U. S. C.
§7410(a)(2)(D)(i)(I). Recall that EPA’s plan rested on an
assumption that all 23 upwind States would adopt
emissions-reduction tools up to a “uniform” level of “costs” to the
point of diminishing returns. 87 Fed. Reg. 20076, 20095; 88 Fed.
Reg. 36661, 36683–36684, 36719; see Part I–C, supra. But as
the applicants ask: What happens—as in fact did happen—when many of
the upwind States fall out of the planned FIP and it may now cover
only a fraction of the States and emissions EPA anticipated? See,
e.g., States’ Application 16–21; Application for
American Forest & Paper Association et al. 14–15, 19–20.
Does that affect the “knee in the curve,” or the point at which the
remaining States might still “maximiz[e] cost-effectiv[e]” downwind
ozone-level improvements? 87 Fed. Reg. 20055. As “the mix of states
changes, . . . and their particular technologies and
industries drop out with them,” might the point at which
emissions-control measures maximize cost-effective downwind
air-quality improvements also shift? Tr. of Oral Arg. 6.

															Although commenters posed this concern to EPA
during the notice and comment period, see Part I–C, supra,
EPA offered no reasoned response. Indeed, at argument the
government acknowledged that it could not represent with certainty
whether the cost-effectiveness analysis it performed collectively
for 23 States would yield the same results and command the same
emissions-control measures if conducted for, say, just one State.
Tr. of Oral Arg. 58–59. Perhaps there is some explanation why the
number and identity of participating States does not affect what
measures maximize cost-effective downwind air-quality improvements.
But if there is an explanation, it does not appear in the final
rule. As a result, the applicants are likely to prevail on their
argument that EPA’s final rule was not “reasonably explained,”
Prometheus Radio Project, 592 U. S., at 423, that the
agency failed to supply “a satisfactory explanation for its
action[,]” State Farm Mut. Automobile Ins. Co., 463
U. S., at 43, and that it instead ignored “an important aspect
of the problem” before it, ibid. The applicants are
therefore likely to be entitled to “revers[al]” of the FIP’s
mandates on them. §7607(d)(9).[10]

															III

															A

															Resisting this conclusion, EPA advances three
alternative arguments.

															First, the government insists, the agency
did offer a reasoned response to the applicants’ concern, just not
the one they hoped. When finalizing its rule in response to public
comments, the government represents, “the agency did
consider whether the [FIP] could cogently be applied to a subset of
the 23 covered States.” EPA Response 27; see also post, at
17–18 (Barrett, J., dissenting). And that consideration, the
government stresses, led EPA to add a “severability” provision to
its final rule in which the agency announced that the FIP would
“ ‘continue to be implemented’ ” without regard to the
number of States remaining, even if just one State remained subject
to its terms. EPA Response 27 (quoting 88 Fed. Reg. 36693). In
support of its severability provision, EPA cited, among other
things, its intent to address “ ‘important public health and
environmental benefits” and encourage reliance by others “on th[e]
final rule in their planning.’ ” Ibid.

															None of this, however, solves the agency’s
problem. True, the severability provision highlights that EPA was
aware of the applicants’ concern. But awareness is not itself an
explanation. The severability provision highlights, too, the
agency’s desire to apply its rule expeditiously and “ ‘to the
greatest extent possible,’ ” no matter how many States it
could cover. Ibid. But none of that, nor anything else EPA
said in support of its severability provision, addresses whether
and how measures found to maximize cost effectiveness in achieving
downwind ozone air-quality improvements with the participation of
23 States remain so when many fewer States, responsible for a much
smaller amount of the originally targeted emissions, might be
subject to the agency’s plan. Put simply, EPA’s response did not
address the applicants’ concern so much as sidestep it.[11]

															Second, the government pivots in nearly
the opposite direction. Now, it says, if its final rule lacks a
reasoned response to the applicants’ concern, it is because no one
raised that concern during the public comment period. And, the
agency stresses, a litigant may pursue in court only claims
premised on objections first “ ‘raised with reasonable
specificity’ ” before the agency during the public comment
period. Id., at 19–20 (quoting §7607(d)(7)(B)); see also
post, at 8–11.

															We cannot agree. The Act’s “reasonable
specificity” requirement does not call for “a hair-splitting
approach.” Appalachian Power Co. v. EPA, 
135 F.3d 791, 817 (CADC 1998). A party need not “rehears[e]”
the identical argument made before the agency; it need only confirm
that the government had “notice of [the] challenge” during the
public comment period and a chance to consider “in substance, if
not in form, the same objection now raised” in court. Id.,
at 818; see also, e.g., Bahr v. Regan, 6
F. 4th 1059, 1070 (CA9 2021).

															Here, EPA had notice of the objection the
applicants seek to press in court. Commenters alerted the agency
that, should some States no longer participate in the plan, the
agency would need to return to the drawing board and “conduct a new
assessment and modeling of contribution” to determine what
emissions-control measures maximized cost effectiveness in securing
downwind ozone air-quality improvements. Comments of Air
Stewardship Coalition, at 13–14; see also Part I–C, supra
(noting examples of other comments). And, as we have just seen,
EPA’s own statements and actions confirm the agency appreciated
that concern. In preparing the final rule in response to public
comments, the agency emphatically insists, it “did consider
whether the [r]ule could cogently be applied to a subset of the 23
covered States.” EPA Response 27. And as a result of that
consideration, the agency observes, it opted to add a severability
provision to its final rule. Ibid. By its own words and
actions, then, the agency demonstrated that it was on notice of the
applicants’ concern. Yet, as we have seen, it failed to address the
concern adequately.[12]

															Third, the government pursues one more
argument in the alternative. As the agency sees it, the applicants
must return to EPA and file a motion asking it to reconsider its
final rule before presenting their objection in court. They must,
the agency says, because the “grounds for [their] objection arose
after the period for public comment.” §7607(d)(7)(B); see EPA
Response 20–21. As just discussed, however, EPA had the basis of
the applicants’ objection before it during the comment period. It
chose to respond with a severability provision that in no way
grappled with their concern. Nothing requires the applicants to
return to EPA to raise (again) a concern EPA already had a chance
to address.

															Taking the government’s argument (much) further,
the dissent posits that every “objection that [a] final rule was
not reasonably explained” must be raised in a motion for
reconsideration. Post, at 7 (internal quotation marks
omitted; emphasis deleted). But there is a reason why the
government does not go so far. The Clean Air Act opens the
courthouse doors to those with objections the agency already
ignored. If an “objection [is] raised with reasonable specificity
during the period for public comment” but not reasonably addressed
in the final rule, the Act permits an immediate challenge.
§7607(d)(7)(B). A person need not go back to the agency and insist
on an explanation a second time. Tellingly, the case on which the
dissent relies involves an entirely different situation: a
“ ‘logical outgrowth’ challeng[e].” Post, at 7. There,
the objection was that EPA had supposedly “ ‘significantly
amend[ed] the [r]ule between the proposed and final
versions,’ ” making it impossible for people to comment on the
rule during the comment period. Ibid. (quoting EME
Homer, 795 F. 3d, at 137). That is nothing like the
challenge here, where EPA failed to address an important problem
the public could and did raise during the comment period.

															B

															With the government’s theories unavailing, the
dissent advances others of its own. It begins by suggesting that
the problem the applicants raise was not
“ ‘important’ ” enough to warrant a reasoned reply
from the agency because the methodology EPA employed in its FIP
“appear[s] not to depend on the number of covered States.”
Post, at 12–17, 18–19. Then, coming at the same point from
another direction, the dissent seeks to excuse the agency’s lack of
a reasoned reply as “harmless” given, again, “the apparent lack of
connection between the number of States covered and the FIP’s
methodology.” Post, at 20.

															The trouble is, if the government had arguments
along these lines, it did not make them. It did not despite its
ample resources and voluminous briefing. See supra, at 9.
This Court “normally decline[s] to entertain” arguments “forfeited”
by the parties. Kingdomware Technologies, Inc. v. United
States, 579 U.S. 162, 173 (2016). And we see no persuasive
reason to depart from that rule here.

															If anything, we see one reason for caution after
another. Start with the fact the dissent itself expresses little
confidence in its own theories, contending no more than it
“appear[s]” EPA’s methodology did not depend on the
number of covered States. Post, at 14 (emphasis added). Add
to that the fact that, at oral argument, even the government
refused to say with certainty that EPA would have reached the same
conclusions regardless of which States were included in the FIP.
See Tr. of Oral Arg. 59. Combine all that with the further fact
that, in developing the FIP, EPA said it used the “same regulatory
framework” this Court described in EME Homer City Generation, L.
P. v. EPA, 572 U.S.
489. E.g., EPA Response 7–8. And, at least as the
Court described that framework, state-level analyses play a
significant role in EPA’s work.[13] Finally, observe that, while the Act seems to
anticipate, as the dissent suggests, that the agency’s “procedural
determinations” may be subject to harmless-error review,
§7607(d)(8), the Act also seems to treat separately challenges to
agency “actions” like the FIP before us, authorizing courts to
“reverse any . . . action,” found to be “arbitrary” or
“capricious,” §7607(d)(9)(A) (emphasis added). With so many reasons
for caution, we think sticking to our normal course of declining to
consider forfeited arguments the right course here.[14]

															The applications for a stay in Nos. 23A349,
23A350, 23A351, and 23A384 are granted. Enforcement of EPA’s rule
against the applicants shall be stayed pending the disposition of
the applicants’ petitions for review in the United States Court of
Appeals for the D. C. Circuit and any petition for writ of
certiorari, if such writ is timely sought. Should the petition for
certiorari be denied, this order will terminate automatically. If
the petition is granted, this order shall terminate upon the
sending down of the judgment of this Court.

															It is so ordered.

 EPA also added three more

 Commenters pointed out
the variance among emissions-producing facilities too. See,
e.g., Comments of Indiana Municipal Power Agency 9

highly variable” across different power plants); Comments of Lower
Colorado River Authority 21 (June 21, 2022) (power plants that
“have already invested” in one emissions-control tool “have already
undertaken significant costs to achieve [nitrous oxide] reductions
and have less to gain from additional control installation”);
Comments of Air Stewardship Coalition 27 (June 21, 2022) (noting
that the knee in the curve appeared to be at a different cost
depending on which mix of industries were considered); Comments of
Wisconsin Paper Council 2 (June 21, 2022) (the air-quality benefits
from controlling one industry—pulp and paper mills—had a “maximum
estimated improvement” in ozone levels in downwind States of just
0.0117 parts per billion).

 The final FIP covered 23
States. 88 Fed. Reg. 36654, 36656 (2023). That plan included
Pennsylvania and Virginia, but EPA declined to cover Tennessee or
Wyoming at the time, even though it had announced its intention to
disapprove those States’ SIPs. Ibid.; see also supra,
at 4, and nn. 1–2. EPA has since proposed a plan for Tennessee and
several other States. 89 Fed. Reg. 12666 (2024).

the litigation over the Nevada SIP disapproval. 89 Fed. Reg. 35091
(2024).

 Of course, this could
change again as litigation over the SIP denials progresses past
preliminary stay litigation and toward final decisions on the
merits.

 Approaching the
applications before us like any other stay request both accords
with the Clean Air Act’s text, see 42 U. S. C. §7607(d),
and usual practice in this field, see, e.g.,
Texas v. EPA, 829 F.3d 405, 424 (CA5 2016); West
Virginia v. EPA, 90 F. 4th 323, 331 (CA4 2024);
In re Murray Energy Corp., 788 F.3d 330, 335 (CADC
2015).
10  Various applicants offer various
other reasons why they believe they are likely to succeed in
challenging EPA’s FIP. Having found that they are likely to succeed
on the basis discussed above, however, we have no occasion to
address those other arguments.
11  As
the applicants conceded at oral argument, see Tr. of Oral Arg.
25–26, EPA did not need to address every possible permutation when
it sought to adopt a multi-State FIP. Our conclusion is narrower:
When faced with comments like the ones it received, EPA needed to
explain why it believed its rule would continue to offer
cost-effective improvements in downwind air quality with only a
subset of the States it originally intended to cover. To be sure,
after this Court heard argument, EPA issued a document in which it
sought to provide further explanations for the course it pursued.
See 89 Fed. Reg. 23526 (2024). But the government has not suggested
that we should consult this analysis in assessing the validity of
the final rule. See Letter from E. Prelogar, Solicitor General, to
S. Harris, Clerk of Court 1 (Mar. 28, 2024). Nor could it, since
the Clean Air Act prevents us (and courts that may in the future
assess the FIP’s merits) from consulting explanations and
information offered after the rule’s promulgation. See 42
U. S. C. §§7607(d)(6)(C) (“The promulgated rule may not
be based (in part or whole) on any information or data which has
not been placed in the docket as of the date of such
promulgation”), 7607(d)(7)(A) (restricting the “record for judicial
review”). We therefore look to only “the grounds that the agency
invoked when it” promulgated the FIP. Michigan v.
EPA, 576 U.S.
743, 758 (2015). Should the applicants show the FIP was
arbitrary or capricious on the existing record, as we have
concluded is likely, the Clean Air Act entitles them to
“revers[al]” of that rule’s mandates on them.
§7607(d)(9)(A).
12  The
dissent resorts to a “hair-splitting approach” to the public
comments. Post, at 8–11. It stresses, for example, that some
comments highlighted variances among specific emissions-producing
facilities and industries, “not States.” Post, at 8
(emphasis deleted). But the dissent fails to acknowledge that, for
purposes of the FIP, States are a sum of their emissions-producing
facilities. See, e.g., Ozone Transport Policy Analysis Final
Rule TSD 12 (EPA–HQ–OAR–2021–0668, 2023) (Final Ozone Analysis).
Similarly, the dissent characterizes the comment indicating EPA
would need to “conduct a new assessment and modeling” if States
dropped out of the FIP as a complaint about the “sequencing” of the
proposed SIP disapprovals and the FIP. Post, at 10. But why
would the sequencing matter? Because the FIP cannot apply to a
State if its SIP is not disapproved. See Part I–A, supra.
And why would EPA need to perform a “new assessment and modeling of
contribution”? Because it may be that “the math . . .
wouldn’t necessarily turn out the same” if some States were not
covered by the FIP. Tr. of Oral Arg. 59. Fairly on notice of the
concern, EPA needed to, and by its own admission sought to,
“consider” whether its FIP could apply to a subset of States. EPA
Response 27.
13  The
agency, we said, “first calculated, for each upwind State, the
quantity of emissions the State could eliminate at each of several
cost [levels]”; next, it “conducted complex modeling to establish
the combined effect of the upwind reductions projected at each cost
[level] would have on air quality in downwind States”; and only
after all that did the agency “then identif[y] significant cost
[levels]” to use in setting its emissions budgets. EME Homer
City, 572 U. S., at 501–502.
14  Admittedly, the dissent points to
some statements in the FIP suggesting EPA considered nationwide
data in parts of its analysis. See, e.g.,
post, at 14; see also, e.g., 88 Fed. Reg.
36721, 36727. But other statements in that rule and supporting
documents also seem to suggest EPA considered state-specific
information. See Part I–C, supra. If, as the dissent posits,
only nationwide data informed EPA’s analysis, why would EPA say
that, “for purposes of identifying the appropriate level of
control,” it focused on “the 23 upwind states that were linked” to
the downwind States, rather than, say, “all states in the
contiguous U.S.”? Final Ozone Analysis 3 (footnote omitted). Why
would EPA explain that its “findings regarding air quality
improvement” downwind were a “central component” of picking the
appropriate cost levels and so defining a State’s significant
contribution? 88 Fed. Reg. 36741. And why would EPA bother to
“determine the relationship between changes in emissions and
changes in ozone contributions on a state-by-state . . .
basis” and “calibrat[e]” that relationship “based on state-specific
source apportionment”? Final Ozone Analysis 43. In asking these
questions, we do not profess answers; we simply highlight further
reasons for caution.
