															SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

															_________________

															No. 22–1074

															_________________

															GEORGE SHEETZ, PETITIONER v. COUNTY OF
EL DORADO, CALIFORNIA

															on writ of certiorari to the court of appeal
of california, third appellate district

															[April 12, 2024]

															

															Justice Sotomayor, with whom Justice Jackson
joins, concurring.

															I join the Court’s resolution of the limited
question presented in this case, that conditions on building
permits are “not exempt from scrutiny under Nollan and
Dolan just because a legislature imposed them.” Ante,
at 10; see Nollan v. California Coastal Comm’n,
483 U.S.
825 (1987); Dolan v. City of Tigard, 512 U.S.
374 (1994). There is, however, an important threshold question
to any application of Nollan/Dolan scrutiny: whether
the permit condition would be a compensable taking if imposed
outside the permitting context.

															“A predicate for any unconstitutional conditions
claim is that the government could not have constitutionally
ordered the person asserting the claim to do what it attempted to
pressure that person into doing.” Koontz v. St. Johns
River Water Management Dist., 570 U.S.
595, 612 (2013). In the takings context,
Nollan/Dolan scrutiny therefore applies only when the
condition at issue would have been a compensable taking if imposed
outside the permitting process. See Koontz, 570 U. S.,
at 612 (“[W]e began our analysis in both Nollan and
Dolan by observing that if the government had directly
seized the easements it sought to obtain through the permitting
process, it would have committed a per se taking”).

															The question presented in this case did not
include that antecedent question: whether the traffic impact fee
would be a compensable taking if imposed outside the permitting
context and therefore could trigger Nollan/Dolan
scrutiny. The California Court of Appeal did not consider that
question and the Court does not resolve it. See ante, at
10–11. With this understanding, I join the Court’s opinion.
