															TRUCK INSURANCE EXCHANGE, PETITIONER v.
KAISER GYPSUM COMPANY, INC., et al.

															on writ of certiorari to the united states
court of appeals for the fourth circuit

															[June 6, 2024]

															

															Justice Sotomayor delivered the opinion of the
Court.

															The Bankruptcy Code allows any “party in
interest” to “raise” and “be heard on any issue” in a Chapter 11
bankruptcy. 11 U. S. C. §1109(b). The question in this
case is whether an insurer with financial responsibility for a
bankruptcy claim is a “party in interest” under this provision.

															Truck Insurance Exchange (Truck) is the primary
insurer for companies that manufactured and sold products
containing asbestos. Those companies filed for Chapter 11
bankruptcy after facing thousands of asbestos-related lawsuits.
Truck is obligated to pay up to $500,000 per asbestos claim covered
under its insurance contracts with the companies. Truck sought to
object to the companies’ bankruptcy reorganization plan primarily
because the plan lacked disclosure requirements that Truck thought
could save it from paying millions of dollars in fraudulent
claims.

															The Court of Appeals concluded that Truck was
not a “party in interest” because the reorganization plan was
“insurance neutral”; that is, the plan neither increased Truck’s
prepetition obligations nor impaired its rights under the insurance
contracts. This Court disagrees. The insurance neutrality doctrine
conflates the merits of an insurer’s objection with the threshold
§1109(b) question of who qualifies as a “party in interest.”
Section 1109(b) asks whether the reorganization proceedings might
directly affect a prospective party, not how a particular
reorganization plan actually affects that party.

															Truck is a “party in interest” under §1109(b).
An insurer with financial responsibility for a bankruptcy claim is
sufficiently concerned with, or affected by, the proceedings to be
a “party in interest” that can raise objections to a reorganization
plan. Section 1109(b) grants insurers neither a vote nor a veto; it
simply provides them a voice in the proceedings.

															A

															Bankruptcy offers individuals and businesses
in financial distress a fresh start to reorganize, discharge their
debts, and maximize the property available to creditors. “Chapter
11 of the Bankruptcy Code enables a debtor company to reorganize
its business under a court-approved plan governing the distribution
of assets to creditors.” U. S. Bank N. A. v.
Village at Lakeridge, LLC, 583 U.S. 387, 389 (2018). This
plan, which is primarily the product of negotiations between the
debtor and creditors, “govern[s] the distribution of valuable
assets from the debtor’s estate and often keep[s] the business
operating as a going concern.” Czyzewski v. Jevic Holding
Corp., 580 U.S. 451, 455 (2017). Chapter 11 strikes “a balance
between a debtor’s interest in reorganizing and restructuring its
debts and the creditors’ interest in maximizing the value of the
bankruptcy estate.” Florida Dept. of Revenue v.
Piccadilly Cafeterias, Inc., 554 U.S.
33, 51 (2008).

															Section 1109(b) of the Bankruptcy Code addresses
which stakeholders can participate, and to what extent, in these
reorganization proceedings:

															“A party in interest, including the
debtor, the trustee, a creditors’ committee, an equity security
holders’ committee, a creditor, an equity security holder, or any
indenture trustee, may raise and may appear and be heard on any
issue in a case under this chapter.”

															A “party in interest” enjoys certain rights in
the proceedings, including the ability to file a Chapter 11 plan
when a trustee has been appointed, 11 U. S. C.
§1121(c)(1); request the appointment or removal of a trustee,
§§1104, 1105; challenge the good faith of persons voting to approve
a plan, §1126(e); and object to confirmation of a plan,
§1128(b).

															B

															This case concerns the Chapter 11
reorganization of companies facing overwhelming asbestos liability.
Exposure to asbestos, a natural mineral used in industrial work,
has led to devastating health consequences for millions of people.
See National Cancer Institute, Asbestos Exposure and Cancer Risk
(Nov. 29, 2021). Companies filing for bankruptcy because of
asbestos liability face unique challenges. “ ‘[B]ecause of a
latency period that may last as long as 40 years for some asbestos
related diseases, a continuing stream of claims can be
expected.’ ” Amchem Products, Inc. v. Windsor,
521 U.S.
591, 598 (1997). Claims therefore arrive on a long and
unpredictable timeline. If bankruptcy proceedings resolved only
existing asbestos liability, companies would face unknown future
liability and claimants might be unable to recover just because
their injuries had not yet manifested.

															Congress responded to these challenges in
§524(g) of the Bankruptcy Code. This section allows a Chapter 11
debtor with substantial asbestos-related liability to establish and
fund a trust that assumes the debtor’s liability for “damages
allegedly caused by the presence of, or exposure to, asbestos or
asbestos-containing products.” §524(g)(2)(B)(i)(I). Section 524(g)
then channels all present and future claims into the trust by
“enjoin[ing] entities from taking legal action for the purpose of
directly or indirectly collecting, recovering, or receiving payment
or recovery” for claims “to be paid in whole or in part by [the]
trust.” Finally, §524(g) imposes safeguards, including the
appointment of a representative to protect the interest of future
claimants, §524(g)(4)(B)(i); treatment of “present claims and
future demands that involve similar claims in substantially the
same manner,” §524(g)(2)(B)(ii)(V); and approval from at least 75%
of current claimants, §524(g)(2)(B)(ii)(IV)(bb). This all
“ensure[s] that health claims can be asserted only against the
Trust and that [the company’s] operating entities will be protected
from an onslaught of crippling lawsuits that could jeopardize the
entire reorganization effort.” Kane v. Johns-Mansville
Corp., 843 F.2d 636, 640 (CA2 1988). It also ensures that
“future claimants” are “treated identically to the present
claimants.” Ibid.

															C

															Kaiser Gypsum Company, Inc., and its parent
company, Hanson Permanente Cement, Inc., manufactured and sold
products that, at some point, contained asbestos. The companies
faced tens of thousands of asbestos-related lawsuits as a result.
To resolve their liabilities, both companies (Debtors) filed for
Chapter 11 bankruptcy. The Bankruptcy Court in turn appointed
representatives for the current and future asbestos claimants
(Claimants). The Debtors eventually agreed on a proposed
reorganization plan (Plan) with the Claimants, various creditors
and government agencies, and all but one of their insurance
providers.

															The Plan creates a §524(g) Asbestos Personal
Injury Trust (Trust) that assumes the Debtors’ liabilities and is
funded by the Debtors and their parent company. The Plan also
transfers “all of the Debtors’ rights” under their insurance
contracts to the Trust, including “all rights to coverage and
insurance proceeds.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 181a.

															Truck was the Debtors’ primary insurer. It
issued policies that covered the Debtors from 1965 through 1983.
Truck is contractually obligated to defend each covered asbestos
personal injury claim and typically indemnify the Debtors for up to
$500,000 per claim. The Debtors have to pay a $5,000 deductible per
claim, and assist and cooperate with Truck in defending against the
claims. The Plan required the Bankruptcy Court to make a finding
that the Debtors’ conduct in the bankruptcy proceedings neither
violated this assistance-and-cooperation duty nor breached any
implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing (Plan Finding).

															The Plan treats insured and uninsured claims
differently. Insured claims are filed “in the tort system to obtain
the benefit of [the] insurance coverage.” Id., at 241a.
Truck has to defend these lawsuits, and if the claimant obtains a
favorable judgment, the Trust pays the deductible and Truck pays up
to $500,000 per claim. Uninsured claims, however, are submitted
directly to the Trust for resolution. As part of that process,
claimants have to identify “all other [related] claims” and file a
release authorizing the Trust to obtain documentation from other
asbestos trusts about other submitted claims. See 2 App. 428–431.
These disclosure requirements are intended to reduce fraudulent and
duplicative claims.[1]

															Truck was the only party involved in the
bankruptcy that did not support the Plan. It advanced three main
objections. First, and most relevant here, the Plan was not
“proposed in good faith,” 11 U. S. C. §1129(a)(3),
“because it reflected a collusive agreement between the Debtors and
claimant representatives,” and did not require “the same
disclosures and authorizations” for insured and uninsured claims,
In re Kaiser Gypsum Co., 60 F. 4th 73, 80 (CA4 2023).
This “disparate treatment would expose [Truck] to millions of
dollars in fraudulent tort claims.” Ibid. Second, the Plan
Finding impermissibly altered Truck’s rights under its insurance
policies “by relieving the Debtors of their
assistance-and-cooperation obligations and by barring Truck from
raising the Debtors’ bankruptcy conduct as a defense in future
coverage disputes.” Ibid. Third, the Trust did not comply
with various provisions of §524(g), including the requirement to
“deal equitably with claims and future demands,” as required by
§524(g)(2)(B)(ii)(III).

															Following the Bankruptcy Court’s recommendation,
the District Court confirmed the Plan. Relevant here, it concluded
that “Truck has limited standing to object to the Plan solely on
the grounds that the Plan is not insurance neutral.” In re
Kaiser Gypsum Co., 2021 WL 3215102, *27 (WDNC, July 28, 2021).
The court found, however, that the Plan was “insurance neutral”
because it “neither increase[d] Truck’s obligations nor impair[ed]
its prepetition contractual rights under the Truck Policies. The
Plan simply restore[d] Truck to its position immediately prior to
the Petition Date.” Id., at *26. The court also rejected
Truck’s challenge to the Plan Finding because the Plan expressly
provided that the Debtors “will continue to fulfill their
cooperation obligations arising under” the policies. Id., at
*27.

															The Fourth Circuit affirmed, agreeing with the
District Court that Truck was not a “party in interest” under
§1109(b) because the Plan did not “increase [Truck’s] pre-petition
obligations or impair [Truck’s] pre-petition policy rights.” 60 F.
4th, at 83. In other words, the Plan was “insurance neutral”
because it did not “alte[r] Truck’s pre-bankruptcy ‘quantum of
liability’ ” given that Truck was “not entitled” to the
“fraud-prevention measures” it sought. Id., at 87. The court
also concluded that the Plan Finding did not alter Truck’s
contractual rights and that the Debtors did not “breach their
assistance-and-cooperation obligations or the implied covenant of
good faith and fair dealing.” Id., at 84.

															This Court granted certiorari to decide whether
an insurer with financial responsibility for a bankruptcy claim is
a “party in interest” under §1109(b). 601 U. S. ___
(2023).[2]

															II

															Courts must determine on a case-by-case basis
whether a prospective party has a sufficient stake in
reorganization proceedings to be a “party in interest.” Section
1109(b)’s text, context, and history confirm that an insurer such
as Truck with financial responsibility for a bankruptcy claim is a
“party in interest” because it may be directly and adversely
affected by the reorganization plan.

															A

															Section 1109(b) permits any “party in
interest” to “appear and be heard on any issue” in a Chapter 11
proceeding. This text is capacious. To start, §1109(b) provides an
illustrative but not exhaustive list of parties in interest. See
supra, at 3. A common thread uniting the seven listed
parties is that each may be directly affected by a reorganization
plan either because they have a financial interest in the estate’s
assets (the debtor, creditor, and equity security holder) or
because they represent parties that do (a creditors’ committee, an
equity security holders’ committee, a trustee, and an indenture
trustee). “The general theory behind [§1109(b)] is that anyone
holding a direct financial stake in the outcome of the case should
have an opportunity (either directly or through an appropriate
representative) to participate in the adjudication of any issue
that may ultimately shape the disposition of his or her interest.”
7 Collier on Bankruptcy ¶1109.01 (16th ed. 2023). This
understanding aligns with this Court’s observation that Congress
uses the phrase “ ‘party in interest’ ” in bankruptcy
provisions when it intends the provision to apply “broadly.”
Hartford Underwriters Ins. Co. v. Union Planters Bank,
N. A., 530 U.S.
1, 7 (2000) (quoting 11 U. S. C. §502(a)).

															The ordinary meaning of the terms “party” and
“interest” confirms this. “Party” in this context is best
understood as “[a] person who constitutes or is one of those who
compose . . . one or [the] other of the two sides in an
action or affair; one concerned in an affair; a participator; as, a
party in interest.” Webster’s New International Dictionary
1784 (2d ed. 1949). “Interest” is best understood as “[c]oncern, or
the state of being concerned or affected, esp[ecially] with respect
to advantage, personal or general.” Id., at 1294. The plain
meaning of the phrase thus refers to entities that are potentially
concerned with or affected by a proceeding.[3] The parties in this case land on roughly this same
definition. See Brief for Petitioner 26 (defining “party in
interest” as anyone that may be “ ‘directly and adversely
affected’ by the reorganization” (alterations omitted)); Brief for
Debtor-Side Respondents 29 (“To the extent Truck acknowledges that
a ‘party in interest’ under Section 1109(b) is someone ‘directly
and adversely affected by the reorganization,’ the parties are in
violent agreement”); Brief for Claimant Respondents 1
(similar).[4]

															The historical context and purpose of §1109(b)
also support this interpretation. Congress consistently has acted
to promote greater participation in reorganization proceedings.
Section 77B of the Bankruptcy Act of 1898, for example, provided
debtors the right to be heard on all issues, but limited the right
of creditors and stockholders to only certain issues. See 11
U. S. C. §207 (1946 ed.). Section 206 of the Bankruptcy
Act of 1938 broadened participation and provided that “[the]
debtor, the indenture trustees, and any creditor or stockholder of
the debtor shall have the right to be heard on all matters arising
in a proceeding under this chapter.” §606. Although the 1938 Act
allowed a “party in interest” to intervene “for cause shown,” it
permitted only the four named parties to intervene as of right.
Still, the Advisory Committee’s Note to Former Chapter X, Bkrtcy.
Rule 10–210(a) (1976), which implemented §206, noted that the
section “was originally enacted to broaden the practice that had
developed upon former §77 . . . . This broader
concept was to insure fair representation and to prevent excessive
control over the proceedings by insider groups.” 11
U. S. C. App., p. 1445 (1976 ed.).

															In 1978, Congress enacted the Bankruptcy Code
containing §1109(b), which continued the expansion of participatory
rights in reorganization proceedings. Congress moved from an
exclusive list to the general and capacious term “party in
interest,” accompanied by a nonexhaustive list of parties in
interest. These parties “may raise and may appear and be heard on
any issue.” 11 U. S. C. §1109(b). “Section 206
. . . and Chapter X Rule 10–210(a), the predecessor
provisions of section 1109(b) of the Code, constituted an effort to
encourage and promote greater participation in reorganization
cases. . . . Section 1109(b) continues in this
tradition and should be understood in the same way.” In re
Amatex Corp., 755 F.2d 1034, 1042 (CA3 1985).

															Now consider the purpose of §1109(b). Broad
participation promotes a fair and equitable reorganization process.
The Bankruptcy Code seeks to prevent “the danger inherent in any
reorganization plan proposed by a debtor” that “the plan will
simply turn out to be too good a deal for the debtor’s owners.”
Bank of America Nat. Trust and Sav. Assn. v. 203 North
LaSalle Street Partnership, 526 U.S.
434, 444 (1999); see also ibid. (discussing Congress’s
concern that “ ‘a few insiders, whether representatives of
management or major creditors, [could] use the reorganization
process to gain an unfair advantage’ ”). Section 1109(b)
addresses this concern. “[D]rafters and early commentators hoped
that an expansive definition [of “party in interest” in §1109(b)]
would allow a broad range of individual and minority interests to
intervene in Chapter 11 cases, and expressly warned that undue
restrictions on who may be a party in interest might enable
dominant interests to control the restructuring process.” D. Dick,
The Chapter 11 Efficiency Fallacy, 2013 B. Y. U. L. Rev. 759,
774–775 (2014). In short, §1109(b) was “designed to serve
. . . the policies of inclusion underlying the chapter 11
process.” 7 Collier on Bankruptcy ¶1109.02.

															B

															Applying these principles, the Court holds
that insurers such as Truck with financial responsibility for
bankruptcy claims are parties in interest.

															Bankruptcy reorganization proceedings can affect
an insurer’s interests in myriad ways. A reorganization plan can
impair an insurer’s contractual right to control settlement or
defend claims. A plan can abrogate an insurer’s right to
contribution from other insurance carriers. Or, as alleged here, a
plan may be collusive, in violation of the debtor’s duty to
cooperate and assist, and impair the insurer’s financial interests
by inviting fraudulent claims. The list goes on. See,
e.g., Brief for American Property Casualty Insurance
Association et al. as Amici Curiae 16–17 (American
Property Brief) (“For example, a plan that purports to maintain an
insurer’s coverage defenses could nonetheless allow claims at
amounts far above their actual value and out of line with the
claimants’ injuries or the payment of claims for which little to no
proof of injury is required”). An insurer with financial
responsibility for bankruptcy claims can be directly and adversely
affected by the reorganization proceedings in these and many other
ways, making it a “party in interest” in those proceedings.

															Take Truck, for example. Truck will have to pay
the vast majority of the Trust’s liability—up to $500,000 per claim
for thousands of covered asbestos-injury claims. The proposed Plan
would have Truck stand alone in carrying the financial burden,
because the §524(g) channeling injunction “permanently and forever
stay[s], restrain[s] and enjoin[s]” any action against Debtors,
App. to Pet. for Cert. 178a, and other “[e]ntities, other than
Asbestos Insurers,” id., at 201a. According to Truck,
however, a plan that lacks the disclosure requirements for the
uninsured claims risks exposing Truck “to millions of dollars in
fraudulent tort claims.” 60 F. 4th, at 80. That potential financial
harm—attributable to Truck’s status as an insurer with financial
responsibility for bankruptcy claims—gives Truck an interest in
bankruptcy proceedings and whatever reorganization plan is proposed
and eventually adopted.

															The Government frames Truck’s interest in a
slightly different but substantively identical way. According to
the Government, Truck is a party in interest because it “is a party
to a contract with the debtor that is property of the estate and
may be interpreted, assigned, or otherwise affected by the Chapter
11 proceedings.” Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae
13. This is just another side of the same coin. Those executory
contracts are the ones that give insurers an interest in the
proceedings and, in this case, make Truck financially responsible
for the bankruptcy claims. So, whether Truck’s direct interest is
framed as its executory contracts or instead its obligations
resulting from those contracts, it cashes out in the same way:
Where a proposed plan “allows a party to put its hands into other
people’s pockets, the ones with the pockets are entitled to be
fully heard and to have their legitimate objections addressed.”
In re Global Indus. Technologies, Inc., 645 F.3d 201,
204 (CA3 2011).

															This opportunity to be heard is consistent with
§1109(b)’s purpose. In this case, neither the Debtors nor the
Claimants have an incentive to limit the postconfirmation cost of
defending or paying claims. For the Debtors, the Plan eliminates
all of their ongoing liability. The Claimants similarly have little
incentive to propose barriers to their ability to recover from
Truck. Truck may well be the only entity with an incentive to
identify problems with the Plan. This “realignment of the insured’s
economic incentives . . . makes participation in the
bankruptcy by insurers—who will ultimately be asked to foot the
bill for most or all of those claims—critical.” American Property
Brief 15–16.

															III

															The Court of Appeals looked exclusively to
whether the Plan altered Truck’s contract rights or its “quantum of
liability.” Under this approach, known as the “insurance
neutrality” doctrine, courts ask if the plan “increase[s] the
insurer’s pre-petition obligations or impair[s] the insurer’s
pre-petition policy rights.” 60 F. 4th, at 83, 87. This doctrine is
conceptually wrong and makes little practical sense.

															Conceptually, the insurance neutrality doctrine
conflates the merits of an objection with the threshold party in
interest inquiry. The §1109(b) inquiry asks whether the
reorganization proceedings might affect a prospective party, not
how a particular reorganization plan actually affects that party.
Indeed, §1109(b) cannot “depend on a plan-specific rule—that
standard would be unusable for the Code provisions empowering a
party in interest to request acts unrelated to a specific plan or
that occur before a plan is confirmed or even proposed.” Reply
Brief 11; see also supra, at 3 (a party in interest, for
example, can file a Chapter 11 plan when a trustee has been
appointed or request the appointment and removal of a trustee).
Practically, the insurance neutrality doctrine is too limited in
its scope. It zooms in on the insurer’s prepetition obligations and
policy rights. That wrongly ignores all the other ways in which
bankruptcy proceedings and reorganization plans can alter and
impose obligations on insurers. See supra, at 11–12.

															In defending the decision below, the Debtors and
Claimants contend that Truck faces similar exposure in the tort
system before and after bankruptcy, in part because Truck was not
entitled to the disclosure provisions before the bankruptcy. That
may be so, but this argument suffers from the same flaw identified
above—at bottom, it concerns the merits of whether the Plan should
include the disclosure provisions for insured claims in accordance
with §§524(g) and 1129. See supra, at 5–6 (describing
Truck’s objections). Whether and how the particular proposed Plan
here affects Truck’s prepetition and postpetition obligations and
exposure is not the question. The fact that Truck’s financial
exposure may be directly and adversely affected by a plan is
sufficient to give Truck (and other insurers with financial
responsibility for bankruptcy claims) a right to voice its
objections in reorganization proceedings. The Debtors’ and
Claimants’ argument also ignores the practical and legal
consequences of the Debtors’ bankruptcy proceedings and
reorganization plan. They transformed the Debtors’ asbestos
liabilities into bankruptcy claims that Truck will now have to
indemnify through the Trust without the protections of disclosure
requirements in place for uninsured claims filed directly with the
Trust.

															Finally, in resisting the text of §1109(b), the
Debtors emphasize the risk of allowing “ ‘peripheral parties’
to derail a reorganization.” Brief for Debtor-Side Respondents 33.
To start, a “parade of horribles” argument generally cannot
“surmount the plain language of the statute.” Arthur Andersen
LLP v. Carlisle, 556 U.S.
624, 629 (2009). Moreover, §1109(b) provides parties in
interest only an opportunity to be heard—not a vote or a veto in
the proceedings.[5] In all
events, the Court today does not opine on the outer bounds of
§1109. Of course, a party in interest is “not intended to include
literally every conceivable entity that may be involved in or
affected by the chapter 11 proceedings.” 7 Collier on Bankruptcy
¶1109.03. There may be difficult cases that require courts to
evaluate whether truly peripheral parties have a sufficiently
direct interest. This case is not one of them. Insurers such as
Truck with financial responsibility for claims are not peripheral
parties.

															*  *  *

															Section 1109(b) provides parties in interest a
voice in bankruptcy proceedings. An insurer with financial
responsibility for bankruptcy claims is a “party in interest” that
may object to a Chapter 11 plan of reorganization.

															The judgment of the United States Court of
Appeals for the Fourth Circuit is reversed, and the case is
remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

															

															It is so ordered.

															

															Justice Alito took no part in the consideration
or decision of this case.

Notes
1
 Without these
requirements, Truck contends, it can be difficult to trace an
asbestos injury to a particular exposure or to identify earlier
claims against other entities. Knowing a claimant’s other exposures
and claims helps prevent inflated recoveries. The Debtors and
Claimants contend that Truck was not entitled to these disclosures
before bankruptcy and could still obtain them in discovery in the
tort system. That ignores the practical and legal consequences of
the Debtors’ bankruptcy petition. See infra, at 14. Indeed,
in recent years, “nearly every Section 524(g) trust has included
almost identical fraud-prevention measures to protect debtors and
their insurers.” Brief for Petitioner 10. In any event, these are
merits arguments on which Truck is entitled to be
heard.
2
 The courts below also
addressed whether Truck is a “party in interest” on the separate
basis that it is “a creditor.” 11 U. S. C. §1109(b).
Because this Court holds that Truck is a “party in interest” based
on its insurer status, the Court does not address alternative
arguments based on Truck’s creditor status.
3
 Legal dictionaries from
the time of §1109(b)’s enactment and onward similarly define the
phrase “party in interest.” See Ballentine’s Law Dictionary 920 (3d
ed. 1969) (defining “party in interest” as a “party to an action
who has an actual interest in the controversy, as distinguished
from a nominal party”); cf. Black’s Law Dictionary 1122 (6th ed.
1990) (“Primary meaning ascribed the term ‘party in interest’ in
bankruptcy cases is one whose pecuniary interest is directly
affected by the bankruptcy proceeding”).
4
 The phrase “party in
interest” appears in other statutory contexts. The Court’s analysis
of the term today does not apply across all other, unrelated
statutory schemes. The term’s meaning elsewhere will turn on the
text, structure, context, history, and purpose of those statutory
provisions, just as it does here. Still, precedent confirms that
this Court’s interpretation of §1109(b) is not an outlier. See,
e.g., Western Pacific California R. Co. v.
Southern Pacific Co., 284 U.S.
47, 51–52 (1931) (competitor railroad was a “party in interest”
under the Transportation Act of 1920 because the challenged
railroad expansion had the potential to “directly and adversely
affect the complainant’s welfare by bringing about some material
change in the transportation situation”); L. Singer &
Sons v. Union Pacific R. Co., 311
U.S. 295, 304 (1940) (food vendors were not a “party in
interest” under the Transportation Act of 1920 because a “person
engaged in business within or adjacent to a public market” was only
“indirectly and consequentially affected” by a railroad “seeking
only to serve a competing market by means of an extension”);
Alton R. Co. v. United States, 315 U.S.
15, 19–20 (1942) (railroad companies were “parties in interest”
under the Motor Carrier Act of 1935 because they were “directly
affected by competition with the motor transport
industry”).
5
 Bankruptcy courts also
have equitable discretion to control participation in a proceeding.
See, e.g., 11 U. S. C. §105(a) (“No provision of [the Code]
providing for the raising of an issue by a party in interest shall
be construed to preclude the court from, sua sponte, taking any
action or making any determination necessary or appropriate to
enforce or implement court orders or rules, or to prevent an abuse
of process”).
