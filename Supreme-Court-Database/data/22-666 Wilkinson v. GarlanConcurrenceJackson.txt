															SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

															_________________

															No. 22–666

															_________________

															Situ Kamu Wilkinson, PETITIONER v.
Merrick B. Garland, Attorney General

															on writ of certiorari to the united states
court of appeals for the third circuit

															[March 19, 2024]

															

															Justice Jackson, concurring in the
judgment.

															The Immigration and Nationality Act plainly
constrains judicial review of discretionary-relief determinations.
It first strips courts of jurisdiction to review “any judgment
regarding the granting of relief ” under provisions including
8 U. S. C. §1229b, which governs cancellation of removal.
See §1252(a)(2)(B)(i). Then, the Act restores judicial review for
only a subset of claims—“constitutional claims or questions of law”
raised in a petition for review in the courts of appeals.
§1252(a)(2)(D). Through these provisions, Congress made clear that
courts should play a minimal role in the discretionary-relief
process.

															In Guerrero-Lasprilla v. Barr, 589
U.S. 221 (2020), the Court interpreted the phrase “questions of
law” in §1252(a)(2)(D) to include mixed questions of law and fact,
i.e., “the application of a legal standard to
undisputed or established facts.” Id., at 225. Today, the
Court removes any doubt that the phrase “questions of law”
encompasses all mixed questions, even those that are
“primarily factual.” Ante, at 15. Thus, an immigration
judge’s determination that a “noncitizen’s removal would result in
‘exceptional and extremely unusual hardship’ ” presents a
judicially reviewable mixed question. Ante, at 1 (quoting
§1229b(b)(1)(D)). Pointing to our precedent, the Court holds that
“Guerrero-Lasprilla compels this conclusion.” Ante,
at 11.

															I am skeptical that Congress intended “questions
of law” as used in §1252(a)(2)(D) to sweep so broadly, given the
statutory scheme. The legislative history of the provision, though
not conclusive, provides additional evidence to the contrary. See
H. R. Conf. Rep. No. 109–72, p. 175 (2005) (noting that “[t]he
purpose” of the provision was “to permit judicial review over
. . . constitutional and statutory-construction
questions, not discretionary or factual questions” (emphasis
added)). As the dissent observes, under a maximalist reading of
“questions of law,” the exception to limited judicial review is
poised to swallow the rule. See post, at 2–4 (opinion of
Alito, J.). If that reading is correct, Congress went through
an awful lot to achieve relatively little.

															I had not yet joined the Court when it decided
Guerrero-Lasprilla. But I agree that
Guerrero-Lasprilla controls this case. The fundamental
principle of stare decisis—“that today’s Court should stand
by yesterday’s decisions”—has “enhanced force” when a decision
interprets a statute. Kimble v. Marvel Entertainment,
LLC, 576 U.S.
446, 455–456 (2015). Congress remains free to revise the
statute, and it should do so if we have strayed from its intent
concerning the scope of judicial review set forth in
§1252(a)(2)(D).

															I concur in today’s judgment with the
understanding that the jurisdiction-stripping provision is not
“meaningless.” Ante, at 15. When reviewing denials of
discretionary relief, courts should respect the choice of Congress,
reflecting the will of the People, to limit judicial interference.
Courts cannot review the facts underlying a hardship determination
in the cancellation-of-removal context, and they should carefully
distinguish between application of the “exceptional and extremely
unusual hardship” legal standard, such as it is, and those
unreviewable facts.
