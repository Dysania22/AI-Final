															SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

															CHARLES G. MOORE, et ux. v. UNITED
STATES

															on petition for writ of certiorari to the
united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit

															No. 22–800. Decided September 8, 2023

															

															The motion of petitioners to dispense with
printing the joint appendix is granted.

															Statement of Justice Alito.

															In a letter to The Chief Justice dated August
3, 2023, Senator Richard Durbin, the Chair of the Senate Judiciary
Committee, “urge[d]” The Chief Justice “to take appropriate steps
to ensure” that I recuse in this case.[1] Recusal is a personal decision for each Justice, and
when there is no sound reason for a Justice to recuse, the Justice
has a duty to sit.[2] Because
this case is scheduled to be heard soon, and because of the
attention my planned participation in this case has already
received, I respond to these concerns now.

															There is no valid reason for my recusal in this
case. Senator Durbin’s letter expressed the view that recusal is
necessary because I participated in two interviews that resulted in
two articles about my work that appeared in the Wall Street
Journal. The interviews were jointly conducted, and the resulting
articles were jointly written, by James Taranto and David B.
Rivkin, Jr. Mr. Taranto, a prominent journalist, presumably either
wrote or approved everything that appeared in the articles under
his byline, and Senator Durbin’s letter makes no objection relating
to his participation in this project. Senator Durbin argues,
however, that Mr. Rivkin’s participation requires me to recuse
because Mr. Rivkin, who is both a much-published
opinion-journalist[3] and a
practicing attorney, is one of the attorneys in this case.

															This argument is unsound. When Mr. Rivkin
participated in the interviews and co-authored the articles, he did
so as a journalist, not an advocate. The case in which he is
involved was never mentioned; nor did we discuss any issue in that
case either directly or indirectly. His involvement in the case was
disclosed in the second article, and therefore readers could take
that into account.

															There was nothing out of the ordinary about the
interviews in question. Over the years, many Justices have
participated in interviews with representatives of media entities
that have frequently been parties in cases before the Court,
including NPR,[4] the New York
Times,[5] CBS,[6] Fox News,[7] National Review,[8]
and ABC.[9] Similarly, many of
my colleagues have been interviewed by attorneys who have also
practiced in this Court,[10]
and some have co-authored books with such attorneys.[11] Those interviews did not result in or
require recusal.

															Senator Durbin’s request for my recusal is
presumably based on the theory that my vote in Moore will be
affected in some way by the content of the articles that resulted
from the interviews, but that theory fundamentally misunderstands
the circumstances under which Supreme Court Justices must work. We
have no control over the attorneys whom parties select to represent
them, and as a result, we are often presented with cases in which
one of the attorneys has spoken favorably or unfavorably about our
work or character. Similarly, we regularly receive briefs filed by
or on behalf of Members of Congress who have either supported or
opposed our confirmations, or who have made either favorable or
unfavorable comments about us or our work.[12] We participate in cases in which one or more
of the attorneys is a former law clerk, a former colleague, or an
individual with whom we have long been acquainted. If we recused in
such cases, we would regularly have less than a full bench, and the
Court’s work would be substantially disrupted and distorted.

															In all the instances mentioned above, we are
required to put favorable or unfavorable comments and any personal
connections with an attorney out of our minds and judge the cases
based solely on the law and the facts. And that is what we do.

															For these reasons, there is no sound reason for
my recusal in this case, and in accordance with the duty to sit, I
decline to recuse.
