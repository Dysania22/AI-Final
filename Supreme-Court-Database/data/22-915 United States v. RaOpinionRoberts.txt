															UNITED STATES, PETITIONER v. ZACKEY
RAHIMI

															on writ of certiorari to the united states
court of appeals for the fifth circuit

															[June 21, 2024]

															

															Chief Justice Roberts delivered the opinion of
the Court.

															A federal statute prohibits an individual
subject to a domestic violence restraining order from possessing a
firearm if that order includes a finding that he “represents a
credible threat to the physical safety of [an] intimate partner,”
or a child of the partner or individual. 18 U. S. C.
§922(g)(8). Respondent Zackey Rahimi is subject to such an order.
The question is whether this provision may be enforced against him
consistent with the Second Amendment.

															I

															A

															In December 2019, Rahimi met his girlfriend,
C. M., for lunch in a parking lot. C. M. is also the
mother of Rahimi’s young child, A. R. During the meal, Rahimi
and C. M. began arguing, and Rahimi became enraged. Brief for
United States 2. C. M. attempted to leave, but Rahimi grabbed
her by the wrist, dragged her back to his car, and shoved her in,
causing her to strike her head against the dashboard. When he
realized that a bystander was watching the altercation, Rahimi
paused to retrieve a gun from under the passenger seat. C. M.
took advantage of the opportunity to escape. Rahimi fired as she
fled, although it is unclear whether he was aiming at C. M. or
the witness. Rahimi later called C. M. and warned that he
would shoot her if she reported the incident. Ibid.

															Undeterred by this threat, C. M. went to
court to seek a restraining order. In the affidavit accompanying
her application, C. M. recounted the parking lot incident as
well as other assaults. She also detailed how Rahimi’s conduct had
endangered A. R. Although Rahimi had an opportunity to contest
C. M.’s testimony, he did not do so. On February 5, 2020, a
state court in Tarrant County, Texas, issued a restraining order
against him. The order, entered with the consent of both parties,
included a finding that Rahimi had committed “family violence.”
App. 2. It also found that this violence was “likely to occur
again” and that Rahimi posed “a credible threat” to the “physical
safety” of C. M. or A. R. Id., at 2–3. Based on
these findings, the order prohibited Rahimi from threatening
C. M. or her family for two years or contacting C. M.
during that period except to discuss A. R. Id., at 3–7.
It also suspended Rahimi’s gun license for two years. Id.,
at 5–6. If Rahimi was imprisoned or confined when the order was set
to expire, the order would instead terminate either one or two
years after his release date, depending on the length of his
imprisonment. Id., at 6–7.

															In May, however, Rahimi violated the order by
approaching C. M.’s home at night. He also began contacting
her through several social media accounts.

															In November, Rahimi threatened a different woman
with a gun, resulting in a charge for aggravated assault with a
deadly weapon. And while Rahimi was under arrest for that assault,
the Texas police identified him as the suspect in a spate of at
least five additional shootings.

															The first, which occurred in December 2020,
arose from Rahimi’s dealing in illegal drugs. After one of his
customers “started talking trash,” Rahimi drove to the man’s home
and shot into it. Brief for United States 3. While driving the next
day, Rahimi collided with another car, exited his vehicle, and
proceeded to shoot at the other car. Three days later, he fired his
gun in the air while driving through a residential neighborhood. A
few weeks after that, Rahimi was speeding on a highway near
Arlington, Texas, when a truck flashed its lights at him. Rahimi
hit the brakes and cut across traffic to chase the truck. Once off
the highway, he fired several times toward the truck and a nearby
car before fleeing. Two weeks after that, Rahimi and a friend were
dining at a roadside burger restaurant. When the restaurant
declined his friend’s credit card, Rahimi pulled a gun and shot
into the air.

															The police obtained a warrant to search Rahimi’s
residence. There they discovered a pistol, a rifle, ammunition—and
a copy of the restraining order.

															B

															Rahimi was indicted on one count of possessing
a firearm while subject to a domestic violence restraining order,
in violation of 18 U. S. C. §922(g)(8). At the time, such
a violation was punishable by up to 10 years’ imprisonment (since
amended to 15 years). §924(a)(2); see Bipartisan Safer Communities
Act, Pub. L. 117–159, §12004(c)(2), 136Stat. 1329, 18
U. S. C. §924(a)(8). A prosecution under Section
922(g)(8) may proceed only if three criteria are met. First, the
defendant must have received actual notice and an opportunity to be
heard before the order was entered. §922(g)(8)(A). Second, the
order must prohibit the defendant from either “harassing, stalking,
or threatening” his “intimate partner” or his or his partner’s
child, or “engaging in other conduct that would place [the] partner
in reasonable fear of bodily injury” to the partner or child.
§922(g)(8)(B). A defendant’s “intimate partner[s]” include his
spouse or any former spouse, the parent of his child, and anyone
with whom he cohabitates or has cohabitated. §921(a)(32). Third,
under Section 922(g)(8)(C), the order must either contain a finding
that the defendant “represents a credible threat to the physical
safety” of his intimate partner or his or his partner’s child,
§922(g)(8)(C)(i), or “by its terms explicitly prohibit[  ] the
use,” attempted use, or threatened use of “physical force” against
those individuals, §922(g)(8)(C)(ii).

															Rahimi’s restraining order met all three
criteria. First, Rahimi had received notice and an opportunity to
be heard before the order was entered. App. 2. Second, the order
prohibited him from communicating with or threatening C. M.
Id., at 3–4. Third, the order met the requirements of
Section 922(g)(8)(C)(i), because it included a finding that Rahimi
represented “a credible threat to the physical safety” of
C. M. or her family. Id., at 2–3. The order also
“explicitly prohibit[ed]” Rahimi from “the use, attempted use, or
threatened use of physical force” against C. M., satisfying
the independent basis for liability in Section 922(g)(8)(C)(ii).
Id., at 3.

															Rahimi moved to dismiss the indictment, arguing
that Section 922(g)(8) violated on its face the Second Amendment
right to keep and bear arms. No. 4:21–cr–00083 (ND Tex., May 7,
2021), ECF Doc. 17. Concluding that Circuit precedent foreclosed
Rahimi’s Second Amendment challenge, the District Court denied his
motion. Rahimi then pleaded guilty. On appeal, he again raised his
Second Amendment challenge. The appeal was denied, and Rahimi
petitioned for rehearing en banc.

															While Rahimi’s petition was pending, this Court
decided New York State Rifle & Pistol Assn., Inc. v.
Bruen, 597 U.S. 1 (2022). In Bruen, we explained that
when a firearm regulation is challenged under the Second Amendment,
the Government must show that the restriction “is consistent with
the Nation’s historical tradition of firearm regulation.”
Id., at 24.

															In light of Bruen, the panel withdrew the
prior opinion and ordered additional briefing. A new panel then
heard oral argument and reversed. 61 F. 4th 443, 448 (CA5
2023). Surveying the evidence that the Government had identified,
the panel concluded that Section 922(g)(8) does not fit within our
tradition of firearm regulation. Id., at 460–461. Judge Ho
wrote separately to express his view that the panel’s ruling did
not conflict with the interest in protecting people from violent
individuals. Id., at 461–462 (concurring opinion).

															We granted certiorari. 600 U. S. ___
(2023)

															II

															When a restraining order contains a finding
that an individual poses a credible threat to the physical safety
of an intimate partner, that individual may—consistent with the
Second Amendment—be banned from possessing firearms while the order
is in effect. Since the founding, our Nation’s firearm laws have
included provisions preventing individuals who threaten physical
harm to others from misusing firearms. As applied to the facts of
this case, Section 922(g)(8) fits comfortably within this
tradition.

															A

															We have held that the right to keep and bear
arms is among the “fundamental rights necessary to our system of
ordered liberty.” McDonald v. Chicago, 561 U.S.
742, 778 (2010). Derived from English practice and codified in
the Second Amendment, the right secures for Americans a means of
self-defense. Bruen, 597 U. S., at 17. The spark that
ignited the American Revolution was struck at Lexington and
Concord, when the British governor dispatched soldiers to seize the
local farmers’ arms and powder stores. In the aftermath of the
Civil War, Congress’s desire to enable the newly freed slaves to
defend themselves against former Confederates helped inspire the
passage of the Fourteenth Amendment, which secured the right to
bear arms against interference by the States. McDonald, 561
U. S., at 771–776. As a leading and early proponent of
emancipation observed, “Disarm a community and you rob them of the
means of defending life. Take away their weapons of defense and you
take away the inalienable right of defending liberty.” Cong. Globe,
40th Cong., 2d Sess., 1967 (1868) (statement of Rep. Stevens).

															“Like most rights,” though, “the right secured
by the Second Amendment is not unlimited.” District of
Columbia v. Heller, 554 U.S.
570, 626 (2008). In Heller, this Court held that the
right applied to ordinary citizens within the home. Even as we did
so, however, we recognized that the right was never thought to
sweep indiscriminately. “From Blackstone through the 19th-century
cases, commentators and courts routinely explained that the right
was not a right to keep and carry any weapon whatsoever in any
manner whatsoever and for whatever purpose.” Ibid. At the
founding, the bearing of arms was subject to regulations ranging
from rules about firearm storage to restrictions on gun use by
drunken New Year’s Eve revelers. Act of Mar. 1, 1783, 1783 Mass.
Acts and Laws ch.13, pp. 218–219; 5 Colonial Laws of New York ch.
1501, pp. 244–246 (1894). Some jurisdictions banned the carrying of
“dangerous and unusual weapons.” 554 U. S., at 627 (citing 4
W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England 148–149 (1769)).
Others forbade carrying concealed firearms. 554 U. S., at
626.

															In Heller, our inquiry into the scope of
the right began with “constitutional text and history.”
Bruen, 597 U. S., at 22. In Bruen, we directed
courts to examine our “historical tradition of firearm regulation”
to help delineate the contours of the right. Id., at 17. We
explained that if a challenged regulation fits within that
tradition, it is lawful under the Second Amendment. We also
clarified that when the Government regulates arms-bearing conduct,
as when the Government regulates other constitutional rights, it
bears the burden to “justify its regulation.” Id., at
24.

															Nevertheless, some courts have misunderstood the
methodology of our recent Second Amendment cases. These precedents
were not meant to suggest a law trapped in amber. As we explained
in Heller, for example, the reach of the Second Amendment is
not limited only to those arms that were in existence at the
founding. 554 U. S., at 582. Rather, it “extends, prima facie,
to all instruments that constitute bearable arms, even those that
were not [yet] in existence.” Ibid. By that same logic, the
Second Amendment permits more than just those regulations identical
to ones that could be found in 1791. Holding otherwise would be as
mistaken as applying the protections of the right only to muskets
and sabers.

															As we explained in Bruen, the appropriate
analysis involves considering whether the challenged regulation is
consistent with the principles that underpin our regulatory
tradition. 597 U. S., at 26–31. A court must ascertain whether
the new law is “relevantly similar” to laws that our tradition is
understood to permit, “apply[ing] faithfully the balance struck by
the founding generation to modern circumstances.” Id., at
29, and n. 7. Discerning and developing the law in this way is “a
commonplace task for any lawyer or judge.” Id., at 28.

															Why and how the regulation burdens the right are
central to this inquiry. Id., at 29. For example, if laws at
the founding regulated firearm use to address particular problems,
that will be a strong indicator that contemporary laws imposing
similar restrictions for similar reasons fall within a permissible
category of regulations. Even when a law regulates arms-bearing for
a permissible reason, though, it may not be compatible with the
right if it does so to an extent beyond what was done at the
founding. And when a challenged regulation does not precisely match
its historical precursors, “it still may be analogous enough to
pass constitutional muster.” Id., at 30. The law must
comport with the principles underlying the Second Amendment, but it
need not be a “dead ringer” or a “historical twin.” Ibid.
(emphasis deleted).[1]

															B

															Bearing these principles in mind, we conclude
that Section 922(g)(8) survives Rahimi’s challenge.

															1

															Rahimi challenges Section 922(g)(8) on its
face. This is the “most difficult challenge to mount successfully,”
because it requires a defendant to “establish that no set of
circumstances exists under which the Act would be valid.” United
States v. Salerno, 481 U.S.
739, 745 (1987). That means that to prevail, the Government
need only demonstrate that Section 922(g)(8) is constitutional in
some of its applications. And here the provision is constitutional
as applied to the facts of Rahimi’s own case.

															Recall that Section 922(g)(8) provides two
independent bases for liability. Section 922(g)(8)(C)(i) bars an
individual from possessing a firearm if his restraining order
includes a finding that he poses “a credible threat to the physical
safety” of a protected person. Separately, Section 922(g)(8)(C)(ii)
bars an individual from possessing a firearm if his restraining
order “prohibits the use, attempted use, or threatened use of
physical force.” Our analysis starts and stops with Section
922(g)(8)(C)(i) because the Government offers ample evidence that
the Second Amendment permits the disarmament of individuals who
pose a credible threat to the physical safety of others. We need
not decide whether regulation under Section 922(g)(8)(C)(ii) is
also permissible.

															2

															This Court reviewed the history of American
gun laws extensively in Heller and Bruen. From the
earliest days of the common law, firearm regulations have included
provisions barring people from misusing weapons to harm or menace
others. The act of “go[ing] armed to terrify the King’s subjects”
was recognized at common law as a “great offence.” Sir John
Knight’s Case, 3 Mod. 117, 118, 87 Eng. Rep. 75, 76 (K. B.
1686). Parliament began codifying prohibitions against such conduct
as early as the 1200s and 1300s, most notably in the Statute of
Northampton of 1328. Bruen, 597 U. S., at 40. In the
aftermath of the Reformation and the English Civil War, Parliament
passed further restrictions. The Militia Act of 1662, for example,
authorized the King’s agents to “seize all Armes in the custody or
possession of any person . . . judge[d] dangerous to the
Peace of the Kingdome.” 14 Car. 2 c. 3, §13 (1662); J. Greenlee,
The Historical Justification for Prohibiting Dangerous Persons From
Possessing Arms, 20 Wyo. L. Rev. 249, 259 (2020).

															The Glorious Revolution cut back on the power of
the Crown to disarm its subjects unilaterally. King James II had
“caus[ed] several good Subjects being Protestants to be disarmed at
the same Time when Papists were . . . armed.” 1 Wm. &
Mary c. 2, §6, in 3 Eng. Stat. at Large 440 (1689). By way of
rebuke, Parliament adopted the English Bill of Rights, which
guaranteed “that the Subjects which are Protestants, may have Arms
for their Defence suitable to their Conditions, and as allowed by
Law.” §7, id., at 441. But as the document itself
memorialized, the principle that arms-bearing was constrained “by
Law” remained. Ibid.

															Through these centuries, English law had
disarmed not only brigands and highwaymen but also political
opponents and disfavored religious groups. By the time of the
founding, however, state constitutions and the Second Amendment had
largely eliminated governmental authority to disarm political
opponents on this side of the Atlantic. See Heller, 554
U. S., at 594–595, 600–603. But regulations targeting
individuals who physically threatened others persisted. Such
conduct was often addressed through ordinary criminal laws and
civil actions, such as prohibitions on fighting or private suits
against individuals who threatened others. See 4 W. Blackstone,
Commentaries on the Laws of England 145–146, 149–150 (10th ed.
1787) (Blackstone); 3 id., at 120. By the 1700s and early
1800s, however, two distinct legal regimes had developed that
specifically addressed firearms violence.

															The first were the surety laws. A form of
“preventive justice,” these laws derived from the ancient practice
of frankpledges. 4 id., at 251–253. Reputedly dating to the
time of Canute, the frankpledge system involved compelling adult
men to organize themselves into ten-man “tithing[s].” A. Lefroy,
Anglo-Saxon Period of English Law, Part II, 26 Yale L. J. 388,
391 (1917). The members of each tithing then “mutually pledge[d]
for each other’s good behaviour.” 4 Blackstone 252. Should any of
the ten break the law, the remaining nine would be responsible for
producing him in court, or else face punishment in his stead. D.
Levinson, Collective Sanctions, 56 Stan. L. Rev. 345, 358
(2003).

															Eventually, the communal frankpledge system
evolved into the individualized surety regime. Under the surety
laws, a magistrate could “oblig[e] those persons, [of] whom there
is a probable ground to suspect of future misbehaviour, to
stipulate with and to give full assurance . . . that such
offence . . . shall not happen[,] by finding pledges or
securities.” 4 Blackstone 251. In other words, the law authorized
magistrates to require individuals suspected of future misbehavior
to post a bond. Ibid. If an individual failed to post a
bond, he would be jailed. See, e.g., Mass. Rev.
Stat., ch. 134, §6 (1836). If the individual did post a bond and
then broke the peace, the bond would be forfeit. 4 Blackstone
253.

															Well entrenched in the common law, the surety
laws could be invoked to prevent all forms of violence, including
spousal abuse. As Blackstone explained, “[w]ives [could] demand
[sureties] against their husbands; or husbands, if necessary,
against their wives.” Id., at 254. These often took the form
of a surety of the peace, meaning that the defendant pledged to
“keep the peace.” Id., at 252–253; see R. Bloch, The
American Revolution, Wife Beating, and the Emergent Value of
Privacy, 5 Early American Studies 223, 232–233, 234–235 (2007)
(Bloch) (discussing peace bonds). Wives also demanded sureties for
good behavior, whereby a husband pledged to “demean and behave
himself well.” 4 Blackstone 253; see Bloch 232–233, 234–235, and n.
34.

															While communities sometimes resorted to public
shaming or vigilante justice to chastise abusers, sureties provided
the public with a more measured solution. B. McConville, The Rise
of Rough Music, in Riot and Revelry in Early America 90–100 (W.
Pencak, M. Dennis, & S. Newman eds. 2002). In one widely
reported incident, Susannah Wyllys Strong, the wife of a
Connecticut judge, appeared before Tapping Reeve in 1790 to make a
complaint against her husband. K. Ryan, “The Spirit of
Contradiction”: Wife Abuse in New England, 1780–1820, 13 Early
American Studies 586, 602 (2015). Newspapers carried the story in
Connecticut, Massachusetts, and New York. Ibid. Reeve
ultimately ordered the man to post a bond of £1,000. Id., at
603.

															Importantly for this case, the surety laws also
targeted the misuse of firearms. In 1795, for example,
Massachusetts enacted a law authorizing justices of the peace to
“arrest” all who “go armed offensively [and] require of the
offender to find sureties for his keeping the peace.” 1795 Mass.
Acts ch. 2, in Acts and Resolves of Massachusetts, 1794–1795, ch.
26, pp. 66–67 (1896). Later, Massachusetts amended its surety laws
to be even more specific, authorizing the imposition of bonds from
individuals “[who went] armed with a dirk, dagger, sword, pistol,
or other offensive and dangerous weapon.” Mass. Rev. Stat., ch.
134, §16; see ibid. (marginal note) (referencing the earlier
statute). At least nine other jurisdictions did the same. See
Bruen, 597 U. S., at 56, and n. 23.

															These laws often offered the accused significant
procedural protections. Before the accused could be compelled to
post a bond for “go[ing] armed,” a complaint had to be made to a
judge or justice of the peace by “any person having reasonable
cause to fear” that the accused would do him harm or breach the
peace. Mass. Rev. Stat., ch. 134, §§1, 16. The magistrate would
take evidence, and—if he determined that cause existed for the
charge—summon the accused, who could respond to the allegations.
§§3–4. Bonds could not be required for more than six months at a
time, and an individual could obtain an exception if he needed his
arms for self-defense or some other legitimate reason. §16.

															While the surety laws provided a mechanism for
preventing violence before it occurred, a second regime provided a
mechanism for punishing those who had menaced others with firearms.
These were the “going armed” laws, a particular subset of the
ancient common-law prohibition on affrays.

															Derived from the French word “affraier,” meaning
“to terrify,” 4 Blackstone 145, the affray laws traced their origin
to the Statute of Northampton, 2 Edw. 3 c. 3 (1328). Although the
prototypical affray involved fighting in public, commentators
understood affrays to encompass the offense of “arm[ing]” oneself
“to the Terror of the People,” T. Barlow, The Justice of the Peace:
A Treatise 11 (1745). Moreover, the prohibitions—on fighting and
going armed—were often codified in the same statutes.
E.g., 2 Edw. 3 c. 3; Acts and Laws of His Majesty’s
Province of New-Hampshire in New-England 2 (1761).

															Whether classified as an affray law or a
distinct prohibition, the going armed laws prohibited “riding or
going armed, with dangerous or unusual weapons, [to]
terrify[ ] the good people of the land.” 4 Blackstone 149
(emphasis deleted). Such conduct disrupted the “public order” and
“le[d] almost necessarily to actual violence.” State v.
Huntly, 25 N. C. 418, 421–422 (1843)
(per curiam). Therefore, the law punished these acts
with “forfeiture of the arms . . . and imprisonment.” 4
Blackstone 149.

															In some instances, prohibitions on going armed
and affrays were incorporated into American jurisprudence through
the common law. See, e.g., Huntly, 25
N. C., at 421–422; O’Neill v. State, 16 Ala. 65,
67 (1849); Hickman v. State, 193 Md. App. 238,
253–255, 996 A.2d 974, 983 (2010) (recognizing that common-law
prohibition on fighting in public remains even now chargeable in
Maryland). More- over, at least four States—Massachusetts, New
Hampshire, North Carolina, and Virginia—expressly codified
prohibitions on going armed. 1786 Va. Acts ch. 21; 2 Laws of the
Commonwealth of Massachusetts from Nov. 28, 1780 to Feb. 28, 1807,
pp. 652–653 (1807); Acts and Laws of His Majesty’s Province of
New-Hampshire in New-England 2 (1761); Collection of All of the
Public Acts of Assembly, of the Province of North-Carolina: Now in
Force and Use 131 (1751) (1741 statute).

															3

															Taken together, the surety and going armed
laws confirm what common sense suggests: When an individual poses a
clear threat of physical violence to another, the threatening
individual may be disarmed. Section 922(g)(8) is by no means
identical to these founding era regimes, but it does not need to
be. See Bruen, 597 U. S., at 30. Its prohibition on the
possession of firearms by those found by a court to present a
threat to others fits neatly within the tradition the surety and
going armed laws represent.

															Like the surety and going armed laws, Section
922(g)(8)(C)(i) applies to individuals found to threaten the
physical safety of another. This provision is “relevantly similar”
to those founding era regimes in both why and how it burdens the
Second Amendment right. Id., at 29. Section 922(g)(8)
restricts gun use to mitigate demonstrated threats of physical
violence, just as the surety and going armed laws do. Unlike the
regulation struck down in Bruen, Section 922(g)(8) does not
broadly restrict arms use by the public generally.

															The burden Section 922(g)(8) imposes on the
right to bear arms also fits within our regulatory tradition. While
we do not suggest that the Second Amendment prohibits the enactment
of laws banning the possession of guns by categories of persons
thought by a legislature to present a special danger of misuse, see
Heller, 554 U. S., at 626, we note that Section
922(g)(8) applies only once a court has found that the defendant
“represents a credible threat to the physical safety” of another.
§922(g)(8)(C)(i). That matches the surety and going armed laws,
which involved judicial determinations of whether a particular
defendant likely would threaten or had threatened another with a
weapon.

															Moreover, like surety bonds of limited duration,
Section 922(g)(8)’s restriction was temporary as applied to Rahimi.
Section 922(g)(8) only prohibits firearm possession so long as the
defendant “is” subject to a restraining order. §922(g)(8). In
Rahimi’s case that is one to two years after his release from
prison, according to Tex. Fam. Code Ann. §85.025(c) (West 2019).
App. 6–7.

															Finally, the penalty—another relevant aspect of
the burden—also fits within the regulatory tradition. The going
armed laws provided for imprisonment, 4 Blackstone 149, and if
imprisonment was permissible to respond to the use of guns to
threaten the physical safety of others, then the lesser restriction
of temporary disarmament that Section 922(g)(8) imposes is also
permissible.

															Rahimi argues Heller requires us to
affirm, because Section 922(g)(8) bars individuals subject to
restraining orders from possessing guns in the home, and in
Heller we invalidated an “absolute prohibition of handguns
. . . in the home.” 554 U. S., at 636; Brief for
Respondent 32. But Heller never established a categorical
rule that the Constitution prohibits regulations that forbid
firearm possession in the home. In fact, our opinion stated that
many such prohibitions, like those on the possession of firearms by
“felons and the mentally ill,” are “presumptively lawful.” 554
U. S., at 626, 627, n. 26.

															Our analysis of the surety laws in Bruen
also does not help Rahimi. In Bruen, we explained that the
surety laws were not a proper historical analogue for New York’s
gun licensing regime. 597 U. S., at 55–60. What distinguished
the regimes, we observed, was that the surety laws “presumed that
individuals had a right to . . . carry,” whereas New
York’s law effectively presumed that no citizen had such a right,
absent a special need. Id., at 56 (emphasis deleted).
Section 922(g)(8)(C)(i) does not make the same faulty presumption.
To the contrary, it presumes, like the surety laws before it, that
the Second Amendment right may only be burdened once a defendant
has been found to pose a credible threat to the physical safety of
others. See ibid.

															While we also noted that the surety laws applied
different penalties than New York’s special-need regime, we did so
only to emphasize just how severely the State treated the rights of
its citizens. Id., at 57. But as we have explained, our
Nation’s tradition of firearm regulation distinguishes citizens who
have been found to pose a credible threat to the physical safety of
others from those who have not. The conclusion that focused
regulations like the surety laws are not a historical analogue for
a broad prohibitory regime like New York’s does not mean that they
cannot be an appropriate analogue for a narrow one.

															4

															In short, we have no trouble concluding that
Section 922(g)(8) survives Rahimi’s facial challenge. Our tradition
of firearm regulation allows the Government to disarm individuals
who present a credible threat to the physical safety of others.
Section 922(g)(8) can be applied lawfully to Rahimi.

															The dissent reaches a contrary conclusion,
primarily on the ground that the historical analogues for Section
922(g)(8) are not sufficiently similar to place that provision in
our historical tradition. The dissent does, however, acknowledge
that Section 922(g)(8) is within that tradition when it comes to
the “why” of the appropriate inquiry. The objection is to the
“how.” See post, at 18 (opinion of Thomas, J.). For the
reasons we have set forth, however, we conclude that Section
922(g)(8) satisfies that part of the inquiry as well. See
supra, at 7, 13–15. As we said in Bruen, a
“historical twin” is not required. 597 U. S., at
30.

															For its part, the Fifth Circuit made two errors.
First, like the dissent, it read Bruen to require a
“historical twin” rather than a “historical analogue.” Ibid.
(emphasis deleted). Second, it did not correctly apply our
precedents governing facial challenges. 61 F. 4th, at 453. As
we have said in other contexts, “[w]hen legislation and the
Constitution brush up against each other, [a court’s] task is to
seek harmony, not to manufacture conflict.” United States v.
Hansen, 599 U.S. 762, 781 (2023). Rather than consider the
circumstances in which Section 922(g)(8) was most likely to be
constitutional, the panel instead focused on hypothetical scenarios
where Section 922(g)(8) might raise constitutional concerns. See 61
F. 4th, at 459; id., at 465–467 (Ho, J., concurring).
That error left the panel slaying a straw man.[2]

															5

															Finally, in holding that Section 922(g)(8) is
constitutional as applied to Rahimi, we reject the Government’s
contention that Rahimi may be disarmed simply because he is not
“responsible.” Brief for United States 6; see Tr. of Oral Arg.
8–11. “Responsible” is a vague term. It is unclear what such a rule
would entail. Nor does such a line derive from our case law. In
Heller and Bruen, we used the term “responsible” to
describe the class of ordinary citizens who undoubtedly enjoy the
Second Amendment right. See, e.g., Heller, 554
U. S., at 635; Bruen, 597 U. S., at 70. But those
decisions did not define the term and said nothing about the status
of citizens who were not “responsible.” The question was simply not
presented.

															*  *  *

															In Heller, McDonald, and
Bruen, this Court did not “undertake an exhaustive
historical analysis . . . of the full scope of the Second
Amendment.” Bruen, 597 U. S., at 31. Nor do we do so
today. Rather, we conclude only this: An individual found by a
court to pose a credible threat to the physical safety of another
may be temporarily disarmed consistent with the Second
Amendment.

															The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the
Fifth Circuit is reversed, and the case is remanded for further
proceedings consistent with this opinion.

															

															It is so ordered.

Notes
1
 We also recognized in
Bruen the “ongoing scholarly debate onwhether courts should
primarily rely on the prevailing understanding of an individual
right when the Fourteenth Amendment was ratified in 1868 when
defining its scope (as well as the scope of the right against the
Federal Government).” 597 U. S., at 37. We explained that
under the circumstances, resolving the dispute was unnecessary to
decide the case. Id., at 37–38. The same is true
here.

 Many of the potential
faults that the Fifth Circuit identifies in Section 922(g)(8)
appear to sound in due process rather than the Second Amendment.
E.g., 61 F. 4th, at 459; id., at 465–467
(Ho, J., concurring). As we have explained, unless these
hypothetical faults occur in every case, they do not justify
invalidating Section 922(g)(8) on its face. See United
States v. Salerno, 481 U.S.
739, 745 (1987) (a facial challenge fails if the law is
constitutional in at least some of its applications). In any event,
we need not address any due process concern here because this
challenge was not litigated as a due process challenge and there is
no such claim before us. See this Court’s Rule
14.1(a).
