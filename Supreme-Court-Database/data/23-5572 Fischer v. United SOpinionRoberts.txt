															JOSEPH W. FISCHER, PETITIONER v. UNITED
STATES

															on writ of certiorari to the united states
court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit

															[June 28, 2024]

															

															Chief Justice Roberts delivered the opinion of
the Court.

															The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 imposes criminal
liability on anyone who corruptly “alters, destroys, mutilates, or
conceals a record, document, or other object, or attempts to do so,
with the intent to impair the object’s integrity or availability
for use in an official proceeding.” 18 U. S. C.
§1512(c)(1). The next subsection extends that prohibition to anyone
who “otherwise obstructs, influences, or impedes any official
proceeding, or attempts to do so.” §1512(c)(2). We consider whether
this “otherwise” clause should be read in light of the limited
reach of the specific provision that precedes it.

															I

															This case concerns the prosecution of
petitioner Joseph Fischer for his conduct on January 6, 2021. That
day, both Houses of Congress convened in a joint session to certify
the votes in the 2020 Presidential election. While they did so, a
crowd of supporters of then-President Donald Trump gathered outside
the Capitol. As set forth in the criminal complaint against
Fischer, some of the crowd eventually “forced entry” into the
building, “breaking windows,” and “assaulting members of the
U. S. Capitol Police.” App. 189. This breach of the Capitol
caused Members of Congress to evacuate the Chambers and delayed the
certification process. The complaint alleges that Fischer was one
of those who invaded the building.

															According to the complaint, about an hour after
the Houses recessed, Fischer trespassed into the Capitol and was
involved in a physical confrontation with law enforcement. Fischer
claimed in Facebook posts that he “pushed police back about 25
feet,” and that he “was inside the [Capitol] talking to police.”
Id., at 193–194. Body camera footage shows Fischer near a
scrum between the crowd and police who were trying to eject
trespassers from the building. Id., at 195–196.

															A grand jury returned a seven-count superseding
indictment against Fischer. Six of those counts allege that Fischer
forcibly assaulted a federal officer, entered and remained in a
restricted building, and engaged in disorderly and disruptive
conduct in the Capitol, among other crimes. See id., at
181–185; 18 U. S. C. §§111(a), 231(a)(3), 1752(a)(1),
(a)(2); 40 U. S. C. §§5104(e)(2)(D), (G). Those six
counts carry maximum penalties ranging from six months’ to eight
years’ imprisonment.

															In Count Three, the only count now before us,
the Government charged Fischer with violating 18 U. S. C.
§1512(c)(2). Fischer moved to dismiss that count, arguing that the
provision criminalizes only attempts to impair the availability or
integrity of evidence. The District Court granted his motion in
relevant part. It concluded that the scope of Section 1512(c)(2) is
limited by subsection (c)(1) and therefore requires the defendant
to “ ‘have taken some action with respect to a document,
record, or other object.’ ” 2022 WL 782413, *4 (DC, Mar. 15,
2022) (quoting United States v. Miller, 589
F. Supp. 3d 60, 78 (DC 2022)).

															A divided panel of the D. C. Circuit reversed
and remanded for further proceedings. Judge Pan, writing for the
court, held that the word “otherwise” in Section 1512(c)(2) means
that the provision unambiguously covers “all forms of corrupt
obstruction of an official proceeding, other than the conduct that
is already covered by §1512(c)(1).” 64 F. 4th 329, 336 (2023).
Judge Walker concurred in part and concurred in the judgment
because he read the mens rea element of the
statute—“corruptly”—as requiring a defendant to act with “an intent
to procure an unlawful benefit.” Id., at 361 (internal
quotation marks omitted).

															Judge Katsas dissented. In his view, the
language in subsection (c)(1) narrows the language that comes after
the word “otherwise” in subsection (c)(2). He therefore construed
Section 1512(c)(2) as applying “only to acts that,” like the ones
specified in (c)(1), “affect the integrity or availability of
evidence” at an official proceeding. Id., at 363.

															We granted certiorari. 601 U. S. ___
(2023).

															II

															The controversy before us is about the scope
of the residual “otherwise” clause in Section 1512(c)(2). On the
one hand, Fischer contends that (c)(2) “applies only to acts that
affect the integrity or availability of evidence.” Brief for
Petitioner 8. On the other, the Government argues that (c)(2)
“capture[s] all forms of obstructive conduct beyond Section
1512(c)(1)’s focus on evidence impairment.” Brief for United States
13.

															Resolving such a dispute requires us to
determine how the residual clause is linked to its “surrounding
words.” Yates v. United States, 574 U.S.
528, 536 (2015) (plurality opinion); see, e.g.,
United States v. Hansen, 599 U.S. 762, 774–775
(2023). In doing so, “we must ‘give effect, if possible, to every
clause and word of [the] statute.’ ” Williams v.
Taylor, 529 U.S.
362, 404 (2000) (quoting United States v.
Menasche, 348 U.S.
528, 538–539 (1955)). To that end, we consider both “the
specific context” in which (c)(2) appears “and the broader context
of the statute as a whole.” Robinson v. Shell Oil
Co., 519 U.S.
337, 341 (1997); see, e.g., Pulsifer v.
United States, 601 U.S. 124, 133 (2024) (choosing between
“two grammatically permissible ways” to read a sentencing statute
“by reviewing text in context”).

															A

															1

															Section 1512 provides:

															“(c) Whoever corruptly—

															“(1) alters, destroys, mutilates, or conceals a
record, document, or other object, or attempts to do so, with the
intent to impair the object’s integrity or availability for use in
an official proceeding; or

															“(2) otherwise obstructs, influences, or
impedes any official proceeding, or attempts to do so,

															“shall be fined . . . or imprisoned
not more than 20 years, or both.”

															Subsection (c)(1) describes particular types of
criminal conduct in specific terms. To ensure the statute would not
be read as excluding substantially similar activity not mentioned,
(c)(2) says it is also illegal to engage in some broader range of
unenumerated conduct.

															The purpose of the “otherwise” clause is
therefore, as the parties agree, to cover some set of “matters not
specifically contemplated” by (c)(1). Republic of Iraq v.
Beaty, 556 U.S.
848, 860 (2009); see Brief for Petitioner 12; Brief for United
States 12–13. The problem is defining what exactly Congress left
for (c)(2). Perhaps Congress sought to criminalize all
obstructive acts in Section 1512(c), and having named a few
examples in (c)(1), devised (c)(2) to prohibit the rest in one go.
The point of (c)(1) would then be to illustrate just one type of
conduct among many (c)(2) prohibits; it would be subsidiary to the
overarching prohibition in (c)(2). But (c)(2) could well have a
narrower scope if Congress designed it with the focused language of
(c)(1) in mind. Subsection (c)(1) would then prohibit particular
types of obstructive conduct and (c)(2) would fill any inadvertent
gaps that might exist.

															One way to discern the reach of an “otherwise”
clause is to look for guidance from whatever examples come before
it. Two general principles are relevant. First, the canon of
noscitur a sociis teaches that a word is “given more precise
content by the neighboring words with which it is associated.”
United States v. Williams, 553
U.S. 285, 294 (2008). That “ avoid[s] ascribing to one
word a meaning so broad that it is inconsistent with” “the company
it keeps.” Gustafson v. Alloyd Co., 513 U.S.
561, 575 (1995). And under the related canon of ejusdem
generis, “a ‘general or collective term’ at the end of a list
of specific items” is typically “ ‘controlled and defined by
reference to’ the specific classes . . . that precede
it.” Southwest Airlines Co. v. Saxon, 596 U.S. 450,
458 (2022) (quoting first Ali v. Federal Bureau of
Prisons, 552 U.S.
214, 225 (2008); then Circuit City Stores, Inc. v.
Adams, 532 U.S.
105, 115 (2001)); accord, Bissonnette v. LePage
Bakeries Park St., LLC, 601 U.S. 246, 252 (2024). These
approaches to statutory interpretation track the common sense
intuition that Congress would not ordinarily introduce a general
term that renders meaningless the specific text that accompanies
it.

															To see why, consider a straightforward example.
A zoo might post a sign that reads, “do not pet, feed, yell or
throw objects at the animals, or otherwise disturb them.” If a
visitor eats lunch in front of a hungry gorilla, or talks to a
friend near its enclosure, has he obeyed the regulation? Surely
yes. Although the smell of human food or the sound of voices might
well disturb gorillas, the specific examples of impermissible
conduct all involve direct interaction with and harassment of the
zoo animals. Merely eating or talking is so unlike the examples
that the zoo provided that it would be implausible to assume those
activities were prohibited, even if literally covered by the
language.

															The idea is simply that a general phrase can be
given a more focused meaning by the terms linked to it. That
principle ensures—regardless of how complicated a sentence might
appear—that none of its specific parts are made redundant by a
clause literally broad enough to include them. See Yates,
574 U. S., at 545–546 (plurality opinion). For instance, a
football league might adopt a rule that players must not “grab,
twist, or pull a facemask, helmet, or other equipment with the
intent to injure a player, or otherwise attack, assault, or harm
any player.” If a linebacker shouts insults at the quarterback and
hurts his feelings, has the linebacker nonetheless followed the
rule? Of course he has. The examples of prohibited actions all
concern dangerous physical conduct that might inflict bodily harm;
trash talk is simply not of that kind. See 64 F. 4th, at
365–366 (Katsas, J., dissenting).

															Similarly improbable consequences can result
from untethering an “otherwise” provision from the rest of a
criminal statute. Take Begay v. United States,
553 U.S.
137 (2008) (abrogated on other grounds by Johnson v.
United States, 576 U.S.
591 (2015)). The question there was whether driving under the
influence qualified as a “violent felony” under the Armed Career
Criminal Act (ACCA). A “violent felony” was defined in relevant
part by ACCA as a crime, punishable by more than a year’s
imprisonment, that “ ‘is burglary, arson, or extortion,
involves use of explosives, or otherwise involves conduct that
presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to
another.’ ” 553 U. S., at 139–140 (quoting 18
U. S. C. §924(e)(2)(B)(ii) (2000 ed.)). We recognized
that, depending on the context, “the word ‘otherwise’ can”—though
not “must”—“refer to a crime that is similar to the listed examples
in some respects but different in others.” 553 U. S., at 144
(emphasis deleted). And we held that while driving under the
influence certainly may present a serious risk of physical injury,
such an offense was so dissimilar from the previously enumerated
examples that it could not be classified as a “violent felony”
under the statute. Id., at 142–146. The list of crimes that
preceded the residual clause—burglary, arson, extortion, and the
use of explosives—focused on “purposeful, violent, and aggressive
conduct.” Id., at 144–145 (internal quotation marks
omitted). And if that focus did not extend to the residual clause,
ACCA’s 15-year mandatory minimum sentence would apply to a host of
offenses “not typically committed by those whom one normally labels
‘armed career criminals’ ” and that were “far removed
. . . from the deliberate kind of behavior associated
with violent criminal use of firearms.”[1] Id., at 146–147.

															The “otherwise” provision of Section 1512(c)(2)
is similarly limited by the preceding list of criminal violations.
The offenses enumerated in subsection (c)(1) cover someone who
“alters, destroys, mutilates, or conceals a record, document, or
other object . . . with the intent to impair the object’s
integrity or availability for use in an official proceeding.”
Complex as subsection (c)(1) may look, it simply consists of many
specific examples of prohibited actions undertaken with the intent
to impair an object’s integrity or availability for use in an
official proceeding: altering a record, altering a document,
concealing a record, concealing a document, and so on. That list is
followed immediately by a residual clause in (c)(2). Guided by the
basic logic that Congress would not go to the trouble of spelling
out the list in (c)(1) if a neighboring term swallowed it up, the
most sensible inference is that the scope of (c)(2) is defined by
reference to (c)(1).

															If, as the Government asserts, (c)(2) covers
“all forms of obstructive conduct beyond Section
1512(c)(1)’s focus on evidence impairment,” Brief for United States
13, there would have been scant reason for Congress to provide any
specific examples at all. The sweep of subsection (c)(2) would
consume (c)(1), leaving that narrower provision with no work to do.
Indeed, subsection (c)(1) would be an elaborate pumpfake: a list of
four types of highly particularized conduct, performed with respect
to a record, document, or object and “with the intent to impair the
object’s integrity or availability for use in an official
proceeding,” followed in the very next subsection—in the same
sentence, no less—by a superseding prohibition on all means
of obstructing, influencing, or impeding any official proceeding.
Construing Section 1512 in such a way gets the “familiar” analysis
we apply to these types of statutes “exactly backwards,”
eliminating specific terms because of broad language that follows
them, rather than limiting the broad language in light of narrower
terms that precede it. Bissonnette, 601 U. S., at 252,
255.

															Tethering subsection (c)(2) to the context of
(c)(1) recognizes the distinct purpose of each provision. See A.
Scalia & B. Garner, Reading Law 208 (2012) (“evident purpose”
helps define scope of catchall provision). As we have explained,
subsection (c)(1) refers to a defined set of offense conduct—four
types of actions that, by their nature, impair the integrity or
availability of records, documents, or objects for use in an
official proceeding. When the phrase “otherwise obstructs,
influences, or impedes any official proceeding” is read as having
been given more precise content by that narrower list of conduct,
subsection (c)(2) makes it a crime to impair the availability or
integrity of records, documents, or objects used in an official
proceeding in ways other than those specified in (c)(1). For
example, it is possible to violate (c)(2) by creating false
evidence—rather than altering incriminating evidence. See,
e.g., United States v. Reich, 479 F.3d
179, 185–187 (CA2 2007) (Sotomayor, J.) (prosecution under
subsection (c)(2) for transmitting a forged court order).
Subsection (c)(2) also ensures that liability is still imposed for
impairing the availability or integrity of other things used
in an official proceeding beyond the “record[s], document[s], or
other object[s]” enumerated in (c)(1), such as witness testimony or
intangible information. See, e.g., United
States v. Mintmire, 507 F.3d 1273, 1290 (CA11 2007)
(prosecution under subsection (c)(2) based in part on the
defendant’s attempt to orchestrate a witness’s grand jury
testimony).

															The dissent supposes that because the word
“otherwise” in (c)(2) can mean “in a different manner,” “by other
means,” or “in other respects,” (c)(1) and (c)(2) are “distinct and
independent prohibitions.” Post, at 2, 5 (internal quotation
marks omitted). But the word “otherwise” is not by itself
“sufficient to demonstrate that the examples do not limit the scope
of the clause.” Begay, 553 U. S., at 144 (emphasis
deleted). “Otherwise” can link a set of examples to a
general phrase and give it more definite meaning—even in statutory
sentences that rival the complexity of Section 1512(c). See
Finnegan v. Leu, 456 U.S.
431, 437–438 (1982); Breininger v. Sheet Metal
Workers, 493 U.S.
67, 91–92 (1989).

															2

															It makes sense to read subsection (c)(2) as
limited by (c)(1) in light of the history of the provision.

															Prior to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, Section 1512
imposed criminal liability on anyone who “knowingly uses
intimidation or physical force, threatens, or corruptly persuades
another person” to, among other things, shred documents. 18
U. S. C. §1512(b)(2)(B) (2000 ed.). But the Enron
accounting scandal revealed a loophole: Although Enron’s “outside
auditor, Arthur Andersen LLP, had systematically destroyed
potentially incriminating documents,” the statute curiously failed
to “impos[e] liability on a person who destroys records himself.”
Yates, 574 U. S., at 535–536 (plurality opinion). As a
result, prosecutors had to prove that higher-ups at Enron and
Arthur Andersen persuaded someone else to shred documents rather
than the more obvious theory that someone who shreds documents is
liable for doing so. See S. Rep. No. 107–146, p. 7 (2002).

															The parties agree that to plug this loophole,
Congress enacted Section 1512(c)—the provision at issue here—as
part of the broader Sarbanes-Oxley Act. It would be peculiar to
conclude that in closing the Enron gap, Congress actually hid away
in the second part of the third subsection of Section 1512 a
catchall provision that reaches far beyond the document shredding
and similar scenarios that prompted the legislation in the first
place. The better conclusion is that subsection (c)(2) was designed
by Congress to capture other forms of evidence and other means of
impairing its integrity or availability beyond those Congress
specified in (c)(1).

															B

															1

															The broader context of Section 1512 in the
criminal code confirms that (c)(2) is limited by the scope of
(c)(1). Federal obstruction law consists of numerous provisions
that target specific criminal acts and settings. See 18
U. S. C. ch. 73. Much of that particularized legislation
would be unnecessary if (c)(2) criminalized essentially all
obstructive conduct, as the Government contends. Section 1503(a),
for example, makes it a crime to “corruptly, or by threats or
force, or by any threatening . . . communication,
endeavor[ ] to influence, intimidate, or impede” any juror or
court officer. Section 1504 covers attempting to influence jurors
through written communications. Section 1505 covers anyone who
corruptly obstructs congressional inquiries or investigations.
Section 1507 covers picketing or parading in certain locations
“with the intent of interfering with, obstructing, or impeding the
administration of justice.” Section 1509 covers the obstruction of
the exercise of rights or performance of duties under court orders.
Section 1510(a) covers obstruction of federal criminal
investigations through bribery. Section 1511(a) covers certain
obstruction of state or local law enforcement with the intent to
facilitate illegal gambling. And Sections 1516, 1517, and 1518
address obstructive acts in specific contexts, including federal
audits, examinations of financial institutions, and inquiries into
healthcare-related offenses.

															If the Government were correct, then the
“otherwise obstructs, influences, or impedes any official
proceeding” provision—which is buried in subsection (c)(2) of
Section 1512—would largely obviate the need for that broad array of
other obstruction statutes. In light of our obligation to give
meaning where possible to each word and provision in the Code,
Taylor, 529 U. S., at 404, our narrower interpretation
of subsection (c)(2) is the superior one.

															2

															An unbounded interpretation of subsection
(c)(2) would also render superfluous the careful delineation of
different types of obstructive conduct in Section 1512 itself. That
section provides a reticulated list of nearly two dozen means of
committing obstruction, with varying degrees of culpability and
penalties ranging from three years to life in prison, or even
death. Section 1512(a)(2)(B)(iv), for example, authorizes up to 30
years’ imprisonment for someone who uses or attempts to use
physical force against another person with the intent of causing
him to be absent from an official proceeding. See
§1512(a)(3)(B)(ii) (specifying punishment). Section 1512(d)(1), by
contrast, authorizes only three years’ imprisonment for someone who
harasses another person and thereby dissuades him from attending an
official proceeding.

															Reading (c)(2) to cover all forms of obstructive
conduct would override Congress’s careful delineation of which
penalties were appropriate for which offenses. Most instances of
those prohibited acts would instead fall under subsection (c)(2)’s
sweeping reach, which provides a 20-year maximum term of
imprisonment. Such a reading of subsection (c)(2) would lump
together disparate types of conduct for which Congress had assigned
proportionate penalties in (a)(2) and (d)(1).[2]

															3

															The Government’s responses to this surplusage
problem are not convincing.

															It first argues that because other provisions in
Section 1512 would allow conviction in some circumstances on a
“lesser mens rea than ‘corruptly,’ ” they have “a
broader compass” than (c)(2). Brief for United States 34. For
instance, the Government contends that subsection (b) can be
violated by “knowing use of intimidation or threats, or misleading
conduct.” Id., at 35. But the Government concedes that
“Congress did not define ‘corruptly’ for purposes of Section 1512.”
Id., at 44. And while the Government suggests that
“corruptly” is “ ‘normally associated with wrongful, immoral,
depraved, or evil’  conduct,” ibid. (quoting Arthur
Andersen LLP v. United States, 544
U.S. 696, 705 (2005)), it never persuasively explains how
“knowingly us[ing ] intimidation” or “threat[s]” against
someone is not “wrongful.” §1512(b). The same is true for most
other subparts of Section 1512 that the Government identifies as
having a lesser mens rea than (c)(2). Brief for United
States 34; see, e.g., §1512(a)(1)(A) (criminalizing
anyone who “kills or attempts to kill another person, with intent
to” prevent attendance in an official proceeding);
§1512(a)(2)(B)(iv) (criminalizing anyone who “uses physical force
. . . against any person” intending to cause them to be
absent from an official proceeding). None of those other provisions
has a mens rea the Government may more readily establish
than the “corruptly” mens rea of subsection (c)(2).

															The Government also contends that its
interpretation creates no surplusage because Section 1512’s other
“provisions sweep more broadly than an official proceeding.” Tr. of
Oral Arg. 64; Brief for United States 34. To be sure, subsections
(a)(2)(C), (b)(3), and (d)(2) criminalize various means of
preventing someone from giving a judge or law enforcement officer
information relating to the commission or possible commission of a
federal offense or a violation of conditions of supervised release.
And subsections (d)(3) and (4) make it a crime to harass someone
and thereby dissuade them from arresting or prosecuting a person
alleged to have committed a federal offense. None of these crimes
requires an “official proceeding.” But not much if any conduct
covered by those provisions would escape the Government’s expansive
interpretation of subsection (c)(2). For a person to have violated
(c)(2), “an official proceeding need not be pending or about to be
instituted.” §1512(f )(1). And because interference with an
arrest or with communications to authorities about federal offenses
could very well obstruct the initiation of future official
proceedings, the Government’s reading of (c)(2) would still often
consume violations of (a)(2)(C), (b)(3), and (d)(2), (3), and
(4).

															The dissent tries to solve this surplusage
problem by arguing that conduct only violates (c)(2) if it has a
“ ‘relationship in time, causation, or logic’ ” with an
official proceeding. Post, at 11 (quoting United
States v. Aguilar, 515 U.S.
593, 599 (1995)). Assuming there is such a requirement, it
would simply mean that the defendant’s actions “must have the
natural and probable effect” of interfering with the proceeding.
Id., at 599 (internal quotation marks omitted). Such a bar
on prosecutions based on “speculative” theories of obstruction,
id., at 601, would hardly cabin the reach of (c)(2).

															The dissent points out that our reading creates
some surplusage, too. See post, at 12–13. In a wide-ranging
scheme like Chapter 73, it is true that some provisions will
inevitably cover some of the same conduct. But “surplusage is
nonetheless disfavored,” and our “construction that creates
substantially less of it is better than a construction that creates
substantially more.” 64 F. 4th, at 374 (Katsas, J.,
dissenting).

															III

															On the Government’s theory, Section 1512(c)
consists of a granular subsection (c)(1) focused on obstructive
acts that impair evidence and an overarching subsection (c)(2) that
reaches all other obstruction. Even setting surplusage aside, that
novel interpretation would criminalize a broad swath of prosaic
conduct, exposing activists and lobbyists alike to decades in
prison. As the Solicitor General acknowledged at oral argument,
under the Government’s interpretation, a peaceful protester could
conceivably be charged under §1512(c)(2) and face a 20-year
sentence. Tr. of Oral Arg. 51–52. And the Government would likewise
have no apparent obstacle to prosecuting under (c)(2) any lobbying
activity that “influences” an official proceeding and is undertaken
“corruptly.” Those peculiar results “underscore[ ] the
implausibility of the Government’s interpretation.” Van
Buren v. United States, 593 U.S. 374, 394 (2021).

															Our usual approach in obstruction cases has been
to “resist reading” particular sub-provisions “to create a
coverall” statute, as the Government would have us do here.
Yates, 574 U. S., at 549 (plurality opinion); see also
Marinello v. United States, 584 U.S. 1, 6–11 (2018);
Arthur Andersen, 544 U. S., at 703–704. And there is no
reason to depart from that practice today. Nothing in the text or
statutory history suggests that subsection (c)(2) is designed to
impose up to 20 years’ imprisonment on essentially all defendants
who commit obstruction of justice in any way and who might be
subject to lesser penalties under more specific obstruction
statutes. See, e.g., §§1503(b)(3), 1505. If Congress
had wanted to authorize such penalties for any conduct that
delays or influences a proceeding in any way, it would have
said so. Instead, Section 1512 mentions “record,” “document,” or
other “object” 26 times. See 18 U. S. C. §§1512(a)(1)(B),
(a)(2)(B)(i), (ii), (iii), 1512(b)(2)(A), (B), (C), 1512(c)(1),
1512(f ).

															Rather than transforming this evidence-focused
statute into a one-size-fits-all solution to obstruction of
justice, we cabin our reading of subsection (c)(2) in light of the
context of subsection (c)(1). Doing so affords proper respect to
“the prerogatives of Congress” in carrying out the quintessentially
legislative act of defining crimes and setting the penalties for
them. Aguilar, 515 U. S., at 600. We have long
recognized that “the power of punishment is vested in the
legislative, not in the judicial department,” United States
v. Wiltberger, 5 Wheat. 76, 95 (1820), and we have as a
result “ ‘traditionally exercised restraint in assessing the
reach of a federal criminal statute,’ ” Marinello, 584
U. S., at 11 (quoting Aguilar, 515 U. S., at 600).
The Government’s reading of Section 1512 would intrude on that
deliberate arrangement of constitutional authority over federal
crimes, giving prosecutors broad discretion to seek a 20-year
maximum sentence for acts Congress saw fit to punish only with far
shorter terms of imprisonment—for example, three years for
harassment under §1512(d)(1), or ten years for threatening a juror
under §1503.

															For all these reasons, subsection (c)(2)’s
“surrounding words” suggest that we should not give this
“otherwise” provision the broadest possible meaning. Yates,
574 U. S., at 536 (plurality opinion). Although the
Government’s all-encompassing interpretation may be literally
permissible, it defies the most plausible understanding of why
(c)(1) and (c)(2) are conjoined, and it renders an unnerving amount
of statutory text mere surplusage. Given that subsection (c)(2) was
enacted to address the Enron disaster, not some further flung set
of dangers, it is unlikely that Congress responded with such an
unfocused and “grossly incommensurate patch.” 64 F. 4th, at
376 (Katsas, J., dissenting). We therefore decline to adopt the
Government’s interpretation, which is inconsistent with “the
context from which the statute arose.” Bond v. United
States, 572 U.S.
844, 860 (2014).

															*  *  *

															To prove a violation of Section 1512(c)(2),
the Government must establish that the defendant impaired the
availability or integrity for use in an official proceeding of
records, documents, objects, or as we earlier explained, other
things used in the proceeding, or attempted to do so. See
supra, at 9. The judgment of the D. C. Circuit is therefore
vacated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings
consistent with this opinion. On remand, the D. C. Circuit may
assess the sufficiency of Count Three of Fischer’s indictment in
light of our interpretation of Section 1512(c)(2).

															

															It is so ordered.

Notes
1
 The dissent explains that
we subsequently held the ACCA residual clause void for vagueness.
See post, at 8 (opinion of Barrett, J.) (citing
Johnson v. United States, 576
U.S. 591, 597 (2015)). That our answer to the narrow question
presented in Begay did not resolve a broader constitutional
defect in the statute says little about whether the reasoning of
Begay is relevant here.

 The dissent maintains we
have “ ‘glosse[d] over the absence of any prescribed
minimum.’ ” Post, at 14 (quoting Yates, 574
U. S., at 569 (Kagan, J., dissenting)). Congress might have
thought (c)(2) prohibited conduct of varying severity. But it does
not follow that it designed (c)(2) to reach forms of conduct
already covered in Chapter 73 with far lower maximum sentences. It
would be improper to substitute for those fine-grained statutory
distinctions the charging discretion of prosecutors and the
sentencing discretion of district courts.
