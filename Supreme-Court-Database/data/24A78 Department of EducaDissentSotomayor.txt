et al. v. TENNESSEE, et al.

															on application for stay

															[August 16, 2024]

															Justice Sotomayor, with whom Justice Kagan,
Justice Gorsuch, and Justice Jackson join, dissenting in part from
the denial of applications for stays.

															Respondents challenged a Department of Education
rule implementing Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972.
Respondents contend that the rule unlawfully redefines sex
discrimination; that it violates students’ and employees’ rights to
bodily privacy and safety; and that its definition of hostile
environment harassment is inconsistent with the statute and
violates the First Amendment. Every Member of the Court agrees
respondents are entitled to interim relief as to three provisions
of that Rule: 34 CFR §106.10 (2023) (defining sex discrimination),
§106.31(a)(2) (prohibiting schools from preventing individuals from
accessing certain sex-separated spaces consistent with their gender
identity), and §106.2’s definition of hostile environment
harassment. Respondents’ alleged injuries flow from those three
provisions.

															Today, however, a majority of this Court leaves
in place preliminary injunctions that bar the Government from
enforcing the entire rule—including provisions that bear no
apparent relationship to respondents’ alleged injuries. Those
injunctions are overbroad. To be sure, this litigation is still
unfolding, and respondents might eventually show injuries from the
other portions of the rule. If so, those injuries might merit
further relief. For now, on the briefing and record currently
before us, I would stay the preliminary injunctions except as to
the three provisions above, in keeping with the traditional
principle of equitable remedies that “relief afforded [to] the
plaintiffs” must not “be more burdensome than necessary to redress
the complaining parties.” Califano v. Yamasaki,
442 U.S.
682, 702 (1979); see Madsen v. Women’s Health Center,
Inc., 512 U.S.
753, 765 (1994) (“[An] injunction [should be] no broader than
necessary to achieve its desired goals”).

															I

															Title IX provides that “[n]o person in the
United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from
participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to
discrimination under any education program or activity receiving
Federal financial assistance.” 86Stat. 373, 20 U. S. C.
§1681(a). Congress charged the Department of Education with
“issuing rules, regulations, or orders of general applicability” to
“effectuate” Title IX’s antidiscrimination mandate. §1682. Pursuant
to that authority, in April 2024, the Department issued an omnibus
rule amending Title IX’s regulations, set to take effect nationwide
on August 1, 2024. See 89 Fed. Reg. 33474 (2024) (Rule). The
amended provisions of the Rule cover a range of matters, most of
which do not reference gender identity discrimination and went
unmentioned by respondents.[1]

															Respondents claim they are harmed by three
provisions of the Rule. First, at 34 CFR §106.10, the Rule defines
“[d]iscrimination on the basis of sex” to “includ[e] discrimination
on the basis of sex stereotypes, sex characteristics, pregnancy or
related conditions, sexual orientation, and gender identity.” 89
Fed. Reg. 33886. Second, at §106.31(a)(2), the Rule addresses Title
IX’s application in sex-separated spaces. 89 Fed. Reg. 33887. The
Rule leaves untouched Title IX’s explicit recognition that schools
may differentiate between students on the basis of sex in some
contexts, such as in assigning dormitories and creating athletic
teams.[2] Outside those
statutory exceptions, however, §106.31(a)(2) states that Title IX
generally permits “different treatment or separation on the basis
of sex” only to the extent that such differential treatment or
separation does not “discriminat[e]. . . by subjecting a
person to more than de minimis harm.” Section 106.31(a)(2) further
provides that a policy or practice that “prevents a person from
participating in an education program or activity consistent with
the person’s gender identity subjects a person to more than
de minimis harm on the basis of sex.” (Emphasis added.) Sections
106.10 and 106.31(a)(2) are the only provisions in the entire Rule
that reference “gender identity.”

															Third, at 34 CFR §106.2, the Rule defines
several terms, including “hostile environment harassment.” 89 Fed.
Reg. 33884. “Hostile environment harassment” is a prohibited form
of sex discrimination that, as defined by the Rule, involves
“[u]nwelcome sex-based conduct that, based on the totality of the
circumstances, is subjectively and objectively offensive and is so
severe or pervasive that it limits or denies a person’s ability to
participate in or benefit from the recipient’s education program or
activity (i.e., creates a hostile environment).”
Ibid. Respondents do not object to §106.2’s definitions of
other terms within the Rule, such as “complaint,” “disciplinary
sanctions,” “elementary school,” and “student.”

															Two groups of States filed suits in two District
Courts challenging the new Rule as unlawful.[3] They contend that the Rule unlawfully rewrites
Title IX’s prohibition on sex discrimination to include
discrimination based on students’ gender identity. Respondents
further argue that §106.2’s definition of “hostile environment
harassment” is unlawful under Davis v. Monroe County Bd.
of Ed., 526 U.S.
629 (1999), because it waters down the standard for what
constitutes actionable sex-based harassment: Title IX complainants
can prevail under the Rule by showing the alleged harassment was
severe or pervasive (as opposed to both) and do not need to prove
that the offending conduct denied them access to educational
benefits. Respondents separately assert that §106.2’s definition of
“hostile environment harassment” violates the First Amendment by
chilling or compelling speech, including on issues of gender
identity.

															Accordingly, when respondents asked the District
Courts to preliminarily enjoin enforcement of the Rule, they
focused on the two provisions concerning gender identity—§§106.10
and 106.31(a)(2)—and §106.2’s definition of “hostile environment
harassment.” Respondents alleged that those three provisions would
cause them irreparable harm if the Rule went into effect.
Specifically, they asserted that they would incur unrecoverable
costs in complying with those provisions (and a loss of Title IX
funding if they failed to do so), that they would lose the right to
speak freely on issues such as gender identity, and that they would
be unable to enforce existing state laws that conflict with the
Rule’s prohibition of gender identity discrimination. Although
respondents’ alleged irreparable harm apparently traces back to
just three of the Rule’s provisions, the District Courts
preliminarily enjoined the Government from enforcing the entire
Rule in all the respondent States.

															After unsuccessful efforts to seek relief from
these overbroad injunctions in the lower courts, the Government
asks this Court to stay the injunctions in part. The Government
does not contest the continued injunction as to §106.31(a)(2)
(regulating access to sex-separated spaces) or §106.2’s definition
of hostile environment harassment as applied to gender identity
discrimination. Instead, it asks this Court to stay the injunction
as to §106.2’s definition of hostile environment harassment as
applied to other forms of sex discrimination, §106.2’s other
definitions, §106.10, and the remainder of the Rule’s unchallenged
provisions.

															II

															I would grant most of the Government’s stay
requests and leave enjoined only its enforcement of the three
challenged provisions.[4] A
preliminary injunction is an “extraordinary” exercise of equitable
authority, appropriate only “upon a clear showing” that a party is
“entitled to such relief.” Winter v. Natural Resources
Defense Council, Inc., 555 U.S.
7, 22 (2008). To obtain a preliminary injunction, a party must
establish, among other things, that it would likely suffer
irreparable harm without equitable relief. Ibid. Even when a
party makes that showing, though, a court must tailor equitable
relief to redress the party’s alleged injuries without burdening
the defendant more than necessary. See Madsen, 512 U.S. at
765 (“[An] injunction [should be] no broader than necessary to
achieve its desired goals”); Yamasaki, 442 U.S. at 702
(explaining that “relief afforded [to] the plaintiffs” must not “be
more burdensome than necessary to redress the complaining
parties”).

															Here, respondents’ alleged injuries flow from
the challenged provisions. Even assuming respondents established
that those provisions subject them to a threat of irreparable harm,
enjoining enforcement of the entire Rule appears to go beyond what
was necessary to redress those injuries.

															Consider some of the unchallenged provisions.
The Rule requires schools to provide “reasonable
modifications”Id., at 33896. The Rule also mandates that
schools prohibit staff and students from retaliating against
students who file Title IX complaints, and provides the procedure a
school must follow upon receiving a complaint of retaliation.
Ibid. Those provisions (like many others in the Rule) do not
reference gender identity discrimination or hostile environment
harassment and bear no apparent relationship to respondents’
alleged injuries. As litigation over the Rule proceeds, respondents
might be able to show those other portions of the Rule will
irreparably harm them in a manner justifying further equitable
relief. At this juncture, however, enjoining the application of any
other part of the Rule needlessly impairs the Government from
enforcing Title IX and deprives potential claimants of protections
against forms of sex discrimination not at issue in respondents’
suit.

															Respondents maintain that the Government must
remain enjoined from enforcing the entire Rule because the
challenged provisions “permeate” it. Respondents fail to explain,
however, why enjoining enforcement of the entire Rule at this stage
is necessary to redress their alleged injuries. As an initial
matter, many unchallenged provisions (such as those governing
preemployment inquiries about an applicant’s marital status or sex
and prohibiting pregnancy discrimination) include no reference to
gender identity discrimination or hostile environment harassment.
Respondents offer nothing to justify preventing the Government from
enforcing those parts of the Rule. As for the provisions that do
incorporate the Department’s allegedly unlawful definitions of
sex-based discrimination and harassment, respondents do not explain
how those provisions would injure them while the Government is
enjoined from enforcing the disputed definitions. Take the Rule’s
requirement that employees be trained on “[t]he scope of conduct
that constitutes sex discrimination under Title IX and this part,
including the definition of sex-based harassment.” 89 Fed. Reg.
33886. Even respondents do not argue that the training requirement
is itself unlawful. With the challenged provisions out of the
picture, the “scope of conduct” under that training provision would
exclude gender identity discrimination and hostile environment
harassment, the sources of respondents’ alleged injuries. If there
were any doubt on this score, moreover, the Court could simply have
excluded the provision from its stay order.

															Respondents further assert that the Rule would
be unworkable with the Government enjoined from applying its
definition of sex discrimination. For 50 years, however, Title IX
regulations have not defined sex discrimination, and respondents
offer no evidence that schools cannot comply with their Title IX
obligations without such a definition.

															*  *  *

															By blocking the Government from enforcing
scores of regulations that respondents never challenged and that
bear no apparent relationship to respondents’ alleged injuries, the
lower courts went beyond their authority to remedy the discrete
harms alleged here. The injunctions this Court leaves in place will
burden the Government more than necessary. The injunctions will
also affect the public. Individuals in the respondent states will
be deprived of guidance related to their rights under Title IX, of
updates to the processes schools must follow in investigating their
complaints of sex discrimination, of protections from retaliation
should they file a complaint, and of much more. On the present
record, more tailored relief focused on the three challenged
provisions would have redressed respondents’ alleged injuries
without depriving the public of the Rule’s other provisions.
Because the majority of this Court nonetheless leaves the overly
broad injunctions in place, I respectfully dissent in part.

Notes

 Those provisions include:
a provision requiring access to lactation spaces and “reasonable
modifications” for pregnant students, such as restroom breaks, 89
Fed. Reg. 33888, 33895–33896 (to be codified in 34 CFR
§§106.40(b)(3)(v), 106.57); a provision affirming the legal rights
of parents and guardians to act on behalf of complainants and
respondents, 89 Fed. Reg. 33885 (to be codified in 34 CFR
§106.6(g)); three provisions addressing schools’ obligations in
responding to claims implicating Title IX, including measures to
assist impacted parties, employee-notification requirements, Title
IX coordinator duties, applicable grievance procedures, and
protection of personally identifiable information, 89 Fed. Reg.
33888–33895 (to be codified in 34 CFR §§106.44, 106.45, 106.46); a
provision addressing schools’ obligations to designate Title IX
coordinators, and adopt and implement a nondiscrimination policy
and grievance procedures, 89 Fed. Reg. 33885–33886 (to be codified
in 34 CFR §106.8); a provision clarifying schools’ obligations with
respect to retaliation, 89 Fed. Reg. at 33896 (to be codified in 34
CFR §106.71); a provision clarifying that the Department of
Education’s Assistant Secretary of Civil Rights will not deem a
recipient to have violated the Title IX regulations solely because
the Assistant Secretary would have reached a different decision in
a particular complaint alleging sex-based harassment, 89 Fed. Reg.
at 33895 (to be codified in 34 CFR §106.47); and a provision
addressing what pre-employment inquiries a school may make
regarding an individual’s marital status and sex, 89 Fed. Reg.
33896 (to be codified in 34 CFR §106.60).

 Specifically, those
contexts include membership in fraternities or sororities, 20
U. S. C. §1681(a)(6), separate living facilities, §1686,
and athletic teams, Education Amendments of 1974, 88Stat. 612. The
Department explained in the Rule that neither §106.31(a)(2) nor
anything else in the Rule addresses or alters existing requirements
governing sex separation in athletics, which is the subject of a
separate rulemaking. 89 Fed. Reg. 33816–33817.

 One suit was brought by
the States of Louisiana, Mississippi, Montana, and Idaho, joined by
the Louisiana Department of Education and 18 Louisiana school
boards. Another suit was brought by the states of Tennessee,
Kentucky, Ohio, Indiana, Virginia, and West Virginia, joined by an
association of Christian teachers and a 15-year-old girl from West
Virginia. Several other States and parties have filed similar suits
challenging the Rule and requesting preliminary injunctions within
the plaintiff States. See Kansas v. United States Dept.
of Ed., __ F. Supp. 3d __, 2024 WL 3273285 (D Kan., July 2,
2024); Texas v. United States, No. 24–CV–86, 2024 WL
3405342 (ND Tex., July 11, 2024); Carroll Independent School
District v. United States Dept. of Ed., __ F. Supp. 3d
__, 2024 WL 3381901 (ND Tex., July 11, 2024); Arkansas v.
United States Dept. of Ed., No. 4:24–CV–636, (ED Mo., July
24, 2024), ECF Doc. 54; Alabama v. Cardona, No.
7:24–CV–533, 2024 WL 3607492 (ND Ala., July 30, 2024).

 For §106.2, I would leave
enjoined only its definition of “hostile environment
harassment.”
