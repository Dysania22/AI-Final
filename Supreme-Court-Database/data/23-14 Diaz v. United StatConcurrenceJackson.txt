															SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

															_________________

															No. 23–14

															_________________

															DELILAH GUADALUPE DIAZ, PETITIONER v.
UNITED STATES

															on writ of certiorari to the united states
court of appeals for the ninth circuit

															[June 20, 2024]

															Justice Jackson, concurring.

															I join the Court’s opinion in full. Federal Rule
of Evidence 704(b) forbids expert witnesses in criminal trials from
offering their “opinion about whether the defendant did or did not
have a mental state or condition that constitutes an element of the
crime charged or of a defense.” As the Court explains, Rule 704(b)
is narrow. Against the backdrop of Federal Rules that authorize
admission of all relevant evidence, it prohibits “only expert
opinions . . . about a particular person (‘the
defendant’) and a particular ultimate issue (whether the defendant
has ‘a mental state or condition’ that is ‘an element of the crime
charged or of a defense’).” Ante, at 7. But, as narrow as it
is, Rule 704(b) strikes a very important balance: It allows for
potentially highly probative expert testimony to be submitted to
the jury, while leaving “[t]he ultimate issue of [the defendant’s]
mental state . . . to the jury’s judgment.” Ante,
at 9.

															I write separately to emphasize that, as
Congress designed it, Rule 704(b) is party agnostic. Neither the
Government nor the defense can call an expert to offer her opinion
about whether the defendant had or did not have a particular mental
state at the time of the offense. See ante, at 7. But a
corollary is also true. Both the Government and the defense are
permitted, consistent with Rule 704(b), to elicit expert testimony
“on the likelihood” that the defendant had a particular mental
state, “based on the defendant’s membership in a particular group.”
Brief for John Monahan et al. as Amici Curiae 1
(Evidence Professors Brief ). Indeed, the type of mental-state
evidence that Rule 704(b) permits can prove essential not only for
prosecutors, but for defendants as well.

															I

															This very case illustrates the significance of
mental-state evidence to both parties in a criminal trial. The
Government expert opined (based on his almost 30 years of
experience as a special agent) that, “in most circumstances,” drug
couriers know that they are transporting drugs. App. to Pet. for
Cert. 10a, 15a. Diaz challenged this testimony, and, today, the
Court holds that the Government did not violate Rule 704(b). See
ante, at 7. Notably, however, the Government was not the
only party that relied on this type of mental-state evidence during
the trial. Diaz called an automobile specialist who testified that
a driver of her particular car would almost certainly not
know that it contained drugs. See Supp. Excerpts of Record in No.
21–50238 (CA9), pp. 139–159. That type of evidence is permissible
under the interpretation of Rule 704(b) the Court adopts
today.[1]* Moreover, as the
dissent observes, Diaz might have opted to introduce other types of
expert evidence related to the mental-state element. See
post, at 10 (opinion of Gorsuch, J.). For example, Diaz
could have offered expert testimony on the prevalence and
characteristics of unknowing drug couriers. See Tr. of Oral Arg.
24; see also Brief for National Association of Federal Defenders as
Amicus Curiae 5–16 (NAFD Brief ) (describing numerous
cases involving so-called “blind mules”).

															For the reasons described in today’s opinion,
none of that evidence would deprive the jury of its ability to
decide the last link in the inferential chain: whether Diaz herself
had the requisite mens rea. But, at the same time, having
all of this testimony might have helped the jury determine whether
the Government had met—or failed to meet—its burden of proving that
Diaz knew of the drugs found in her car. Thus, far from disserving
our criminal justice system, see post, at 10, the type of
mental-state evidence that Rule 704(b) permits can be of critical
assistance to lay factfinders tasked with determining a defendant’s
mental state as an element of the alleged crime (or defense).

															Other examples provide further proof. Consider
expert evidence on mental health conditions. Congress crafted Rule
704(b) to prohibit experts from opining on a particular defendant’s
mental state at the time of an offense, but it did not preclude
experts from contextualizing a defendant’s mental health condition,
including by explaining the likelihood that those with a particular
condition would have a particular mental state. For example, as
Diaz acknowledges, the interpretation of Rule 704(b) the Court
adopts today “allow[s] psychiatrists who testify as experts to
. . . tell the jury that when people with schizophrenia
as severe as [a] defendant’s commit acts of violence, it is
generally because they do not appreciate the wrongfulness of their
conduct.” Brief for Petitioner 21–22; see also Brief for United
States 35–36. That type of expert evidence would not result in the
spectacle of dueling experts on the defendant’s actual mental
state, which Congress sought to eliminate when it codified Rule
704(b). See ante, at 6–7; see also S. Rep. No. 98–225,
p. 230 (1983). Instead, given the biases, stereotypes, and uneven
knowledge that many people have about mental health conditions,
such expert evidence could help jurors better understand a
defendant’s condition and thereby call into question a mens
rea that might otherwise be too easily assumed. See,
e.g., United States v. Brown, 
32 F.3d 236, 239 (CA7 1994); United States v.
Thigpen, 
4 F.3d 1573, 1579–1580 (CA11 1993) (en banc).

															Or consider defendants who have been subject to
domestic abuse. “A number of myths and misconceptions about
[battered woman syndrome] victims affect our criminal justice
system,” and it is clear that those mistaken views “affect jurors.”
Linn v. State, 929 N.W.2d 717, 742 (Iowa 2019); see
also id., at 742–746 (summarizing relevant evidence). Rule
704(b) allows experts to testify about the typical mental states of
those with battered woman syndrome, helping jurors to better
understand how those experiencing it respond to aggression or react
to violence. See Evidence Professors Brief 25; see also 29 C.
Wright & V. Gold, Federal Practice and Procedure §6285 (2d ed.
Supp. 2023). Such evidence can play a pivotal role in a defendant’s
attempts both to disprove the mens rea in a number of
serious crimes and to support a range of defenses, including duress
and self-defense. See, e.g., United States v.
Lopez, 913 F.3d 807, 819–824 (CA9 2019); United
States v. Nwoye, 824 F.3d 1129, 1136–1138 (CADC
2016).

															II

															All that said, I fully acknowledge that there
are serious and well-known risks of overreliance on expert
testimony—risks that are especially acute in criminal trials. See
NAFD Brief 21–22, 24–25; see also United States v.
Alvarez, 837 F.2d 1024, 1030 (CA11 1988) (“When the expert
is a government law enforcement agent testifying on behalf of the
prosecution about participation in prior and similar cases, the
possibility that the jury will give undue weight to the expert’s
testimony is greatly increased”). But there are also safeguards
outside of Rule 704(b) to prevent the misuse of expert testimony.
Nothing in the Court’s opinion today should be read to displace
those important checks and limitations.

															This means, of course, that when faced with
flawed or faulty testimony concerning the mental states of groups
or categories of individuals, parties can utilize the traditional
tools in a lawyer’s toolkit, like vigorous cross-examination and
careful refutation in closing argument. Parties can also seek to
employ other Rules of Evidence that might require exclusion—those
that guard against irrelevant or unduly prejudicial testimony, for
example, and those that require courts to bar unqualified or
overreaching experts. See Fed. Rules Evid. 401, 402, 403, 702; see
also, e.g., United States v. Finley,

301 F.3d 1000, 1014–1015 (CA9 2002) (“Expert testimony that
compels the jury to conclude that the defendant did or did not
possess the requisite mens rea does not ‘assist the trier of
fact’ under Rule 702 because such testimony encroaches on the
jury’s vital and exclusive function to make credibility
determinations”); United States v. Lipscomb,

14 F.3d 1236, 1242 (CA7 1994) (describing safeguards that can
be used to prevent testimony from law enforcement experts from
unduly prejudicing a defendant).

															District court judges also have a role to play.
They should be protective of Congress’s intent to preserve the
jury’s core duty, by providing specific admonitions and
instructions when expert testimony about a relevant mental state is
introduced. See Evidence Professors Brief 27–29; see also United
States v. Smart, 
98 F.3d 1379, 1388–1389 (CADC 1996) (requiring that district
courts sometimes use jury instructions to prevent expert testimony
from violating Rule 704(b)).

															With this understanding of both the important
uses and the potential misuses of Rule 704(b), I join the Court’s
opinion.

Notes

*Before this Court, Diaz
forthrightly admits that such evidence would be impermissible under
the dissent’s interpretation of Rule 704(b). See Reply Brief 8; Tr.
