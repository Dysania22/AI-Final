															NEAL BISSONNETTE, et al., PETITIONERS
v. LePAGE BAKERIES PARK ST., LLC, et al.

															on writ of certiorari to the united states
court of appeals for the second circuit

															[April 12, 2024]

															

															Chief Justice Roberts delivered the opinion of
the Court.

															Neal Bissonnette and Tyler Wojnarowski worked as
distributors for Flowers Foods, Inc., a multibillion-dollar
producer and marketer of baked goods. After they sued Flowers for
violating state and federal wage laws, Flowers moved to compel
arbitration under the Federal Arbitration Act. The question
presented is whether the exemption from coverage under that Act for
any “class of workers engaged in foreign or interstate commerce” is
limited to workers whose employers are in the transportation
industry. 9 U. S. C. §1.

															I

															Flowers Foods, Inc. is “the second-largest
producer and marketer of packaged bakery foods” in the United
States.[1] Flowers Foods,
www.flowersfoods.com (Mar. 14, 2024). One of its flagship products
is Wonder Bread, which it promotes with a 95-foot-tall hot air
balloon and a parade float called The Wondership. Flowers also
makes and markets other baked goods such as tortillas, bagels,
Butterscotch Krimpets, and Jumbo Honey Buns in more than 40
bakeries located in 19 States. Ibid. From there, these
products are distributed across the country.

															But Flowers is not solely responsible for
getting its baked goods to customers. Some of its subsidiaries use
a “direct-store-delivery” system in which franchisees buy the
rights to distribute Flowers products in particular geographic
territories. Those distributors purchase the baked goods from
Flowers and then market, sell, and deliver them to retailers. App.
2; 49 F. 4th 655, 658 (CA2 2022).

															Bissonnette and Wojnarowski were franchisees who
owned the rights to distribute Flowers products in certain parts of
Connecticut. Flowers baked the bread and buns and sent them to a
warehouse in Waterbury. Bissonnette and Wojnarowski picked them up
and distributed them to local shops. They allegedly spent at least
forty hours a week delivering Flowers products in their
territories. But their jobs extended beyond carrying the products
from Point A to Point B. They also found new retail outlets,
advertised, set up promotional displays, and maintained their
customers’ inventories by ordering baked goods from Flowers,
stocking shelves, and replacing expired products. App. 1–3, 5; 49
F. 4th, at 658; 460 F. Supp. 3d 191, 194, 200 (Conn.
2020).

															To purchase the rights to their territories,
Bissonnette and Wojnarowski signed Distributor Agreements with
Flowers. Those contracts incorporate separate Arbitration
Agreements that require “any claim, dispute, and/or controversy” to
be arbitrated under the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA), 9
U. S. C. §1 et seq.; App. 64, 133; see also
id., at 37, 104–105.

															In 2019, Bissonnette and Wojnarowski brought a
putative class action claiming that Flowers had underpaid them in
violation of state and federal law. They alleged that Flowers had
taken unlawful deductions from their wages, failed to pay them
overtime, and unjustly enriched itself by requiring them to pay for
distribution rights and operating expenses. Flowers moved to
dismiss or to compel arbitration under the FAA, arguing that the
contracts required the distributors to arbitrate their claims
individually.

															The FAA provides generally that arbitration
agreements are “valid, irrevocable, and enforceable, save upon such
grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any
contract.” 9 U. S. C. §2. It contains, however, an
exception specifying that “nothing herein contained shall apply to
contracts of employment of seamen, railroad employees, or any other
class of workers engaged in foreign or interstate commerce.” §1.
Bissonnette and Wojnarowski contend that they fall within this
exception, and therefore cannot be compelled to arbitrate under the
FAA.

															The District Court dismissed the case in favor
of arbitration. It explained that for Bissonnette and Wojnarowski
to be exempt from the FAA, they must be “transportation workers.”
460 F. Supp. 3d, at 197. And it concluded that their “much
broader scope of responsibility” under the Distributor Agreements
“belie[d] the claim that they are only or even principally truck
drivers.” Id., at 199.

															Without addressing the District Court’s
analysis, the Second Circuit affirmed on the alternative ground
that Bissonnette and Wojnarowski “are in the bakery industry.” 33
F. 4th 650, 652 (2021). And under Circuit law, the panel
explained, §1 of the FAA exempts only “ ‘workers involved in
the transportation industries.’ ” Id., at 655 (quoting
Adams v. Suozzi, 
433 F.3d 220, 226, n. 5 (CA2 2005)). Judge Pooler
dissented because, in her view, §1 asks whether a person is a
“transportation worker[ ],” not “for whom the worker
undertakes her transportation work.” 33 F. 4th, at 662, 666
(emphasis added).

															A month after the Second Circuit decided the
appeal, we decided Southwest Airlines Co. v. Saxon,
596 U.S. 450 (2022). In that case, we determined that a ramp
supervisor who “frequently load[ed] and unload[ed] cargo” from
airplanes belonged to a “class of workers engaged in foreign or
interstate commerce.” Id., at 463. We held that a “class of
workers” is properly defined based on what a worker does for an
employer, “not what [the employer] does generally.” Id., at
456.

															The Second Circuit granted panel rehearing in
light of Saxon but adhered to its prior decision. The court
held that an individual works in a transportation industry and may
therefore be exempt under §1 only “if the industry . . .
pegs its charges chiefly to the movement of goods or passengers,
and the industry’s predominant source of commercial revenue is
generated by that movement.” 49 F. 4th, at 661. Applying that
test, the court concluded that the distributors’ “commerce is in
breads, buns, rolls, and snack cakes—not transportation services.”
Id., at 662. Judge Pooler again dissented, reiterating her
position that the majority erred in “focusing on the nature of
[Flowers’s] business, and not on the nature of [the distributors’]
work”—“the sort of industrywide approach Saxon proscribes.”
Id., at 671.

															The Second Circuit denied rehearing en banc. 59
F. 4th 594 (2023). Judge Pooler, having assumed senior status,
filed a statement opposing the denial. Judge Nathan dissented,
joined by two other judges.

															The Second Circuit’s decision conflicted with
decisions from the First Circuit. Canales v. CK Sales
Co., 67 F. 4th 38 (2023) (also involving Flowers Foods
distributors); Fraga v. Premium Retail Servs., Inc.,
61 F. 4th 228 (2023).

															We granted certiorari to resolve that conflict.
600 U. S. ___ (2023)

															II

															The only question before us is whether a
transportation worker must work for a company in the transportation
industry to be exempt under §1 of the FAA.[2] We conclude that there is no such requirement.

															More than twenty years ago, in Circuit City
Stores, Inc. v. Adams, 532 U.S.
105 (2001), we recognized that §1 is limited to transportation
workers. Adams, a sales counselor at an electronics store, claimed
that §1 exempts all contracts of employment, regardless of
what a worker does. Id., at 109–111, 114. But he failed to
account for ejusdem generis, the familiar canon of statutory
interpretation that courts “interpret a ‘general or collective
term’ at the end of a list of specific items in light of any
‘common attribute[s]’ shared by the specific items.” Saxon,
596 U. S., at 458 (quoting Ali v. Federal Bureau of
Prisons, 552 U.S.
214, 225 (2008); alteration in original). Applying that canon
to §1, we explained that the general phrase “class of workers
engaged in . . . commerce” is “controlled and defined by
reference to” the specific categories “seamen” and “railroad
employees” that precede it. Circuit City, 532 U. S., at
115. And we concluded that the “linkage” between “seamen” and
“railroad employees” is that they are both transportation workers.
Id., at 118–119, 121. The class of workers in the residual
clause was therefore limited in the same way.

															That reading of §1 harmonized the FAA with other
statutes designed to protect the movement of goods in commerce.
Id., at 121. Congress enacted the FAA in 1925 to override
the longstanding refusal of courts to enforce arbitration
agreements. See Allied-Bruce Terminix Cos. v. Dobson,
513 U.S.
265, 270–271 (1995). At that time, though, specific statutory
dispute resolution regimes already covered seamen and railroad
employees—“transportation workers” who played a “necessary role in
the free flow of goods.” Circuit City, 532 U. S., at
121 (citing Shipping Commissioners Act of 1872, ch. 322, 17Stat.
262; Transportation Act of 1920, §300 et seq., 41Stat.
469). An exemption from the FAA for those workers was thus required
to avoid “unsettl[ing]” those schemes. Circuit City, 532
U. S., at 121. The residual clause similarly reserves for
Congress the decision whether to enact additional “specific
legislation for those engaged in transportation,” while “ensur[ing]
that workers in general would be covered by” the FAA. Ibid.;
see also New Prime Inc. v. Oliveira, 586 U.S. 105,
110–111 (2019).

															We again considered the scope of the residual
clause in Saxon, where we expressly declined to adopt an
“industrywide” approach of the sort Flowers advances here. The
respondent in Saxon argued that she was a member of a “class
of workers engaged in foreign or interstate commerce” simply
because she worked for an airline and carried out its customary
work. See 596 U. S., at 460. But §1 refers to
“ ‘workers’ ” who are “engaged” in commerce. Id.,
at 456 (quoting New Prime, 586 U. S., at 116). That
language focuses on “ ‘the performance of work’ ”
rather than the industry of the employer. Saxon, 596
U. S., at 456 (quoting New Prime, 586 U. S., at
116; emphasis as altered by Saxon). And §1 says nothing to
direct courts to consider the industry of a worker’s employer. The
relevant question was “what [Saxon] does at Southwest, not what
Southwest does generally.” Saxon, 596 U. S., at
456.

															Because the Second Circuit in this case
fashioned its transportation-industry requirement without any guide
in the text of §1 or our precedents, it had to figure out for
itself what constituted a “transportation industry.” The court
decided that an entity would be considered within that industry if
it “pegs its charges chiefly to the movement of goods or
passengers” and its “predominant source of commercial revenue is
generated by that movement.” 49 F. 4th, at 661. The
application of such a test, however, would often turn on arcane
riddles about the nature of a company’s services. Does a pizza
delivery company derive its revenue mainly from pizza or delivery?
Do companies like Amazon and Walmart—which both sell products of
their own and transport products sold by third parties—derive their
revenue mainly from retail or shipping? [3] Extensive discovery might be necessary to
explore the internal structure and revenue models of a company
before deciding a simple motion to compel arbitration. Mini-trials
on the transportation-industry issue could become a regular, slow,
and expensive practice in FAA cases. All this “complexity and
uncertainty” would “ ‘breed[ ] litigation from a statute
that seeks to avoid it.’ ” Circuit City, 532
U. S., at 123 (quoting Allied-Bruce, 513 U. S., at
275).

															III

															At the end of its brief, Flowers argues that
our analysis in Saxon actually “suggests” that working in
the transportation industry is a necessary but not sufficient
condition for §1 to apply. Brief for Respondents 43–44. Flowers
also emphasizes a single passing description in our opinion of
“seamen” as “a subset of workers engaged in the maritime shipping
industry.” Saxon, 596 U. S., at 460. But this reading
of Saxon misses the basis for our holding in that case.
Saxon rejected the proposition that there is an industrywide
link between “seamen” and “railroad employees”—a “flawed premise”
that is essential to Flowers’s position here. Ibid. Those
classes of workers, as we read the statute then and now, are
connected by what they do, not for whom they do it.

															Flowers also points to historical statutes
regulating certain seamen and railroad employees to show that those
terms were limited to transportation-industry workers in 1925.
Brief for Respondents 15–27. But those statutes only prove that
where Congress wanted to regulate seamen or railroad employees in a
particular industry, it said so explicitly—for example, by
specifying that a law covered seamen aboard merchant
vessels, or that a law covered employees of railroad carriers
subject to the Interstate Commerce Act. See,
e.g., The Seamen’s Act of 1915, §2, 38Stat. 1164;
Transportation Act of 1920, §§300(1), 301–302, 41Stat. 469.

															Unlike those industry-specific statutes, §1
refers to “seamen” and “railroad employees” without specifying any
industry to which they must belong. It would be strange to read the
conspicuous absence of similar industry-specific language in §1 as
a sign that Congress defined the exemption on an industrywide
basis. The far more natural inference, which we embraced in
Circuit City and Saxon, is that “seamen” and
“railroad employees” share the employment characteristic of being
transportation workers.

															Nor does construing §1 to cover transportation
workers render “seamen” and “railroad employees” superfluous, as
Flowers contends. See Brief for Respondents 35. That argument gets
ejusdem generis exactly backwards. It is the specific terms
“seamen” and “railroad employees” that limit the residual clause,
not the residual clause that swallows up these narrower terms. Only
by deleting “seamen” and “railroad employees” from the statute
could §1 reach as far as Flowers imagines.

															Having lost on text and precedent, Flowers turns
to policy, arguing that the §1 exemption would sweep too broadly
without an implied transportation-industry requirement. Because
“virtually all products move in interstate commerce,” Flowers warns
that virtually all workers who load or unload goods—from pet shop
employees to grocery store clerks—will be exempt from arbitration.
Id., at 46–47.

															We have never understood §1 to define the class
of exempt workers in such limitless terms. To the contrary, as we
held in Saxon, a transportation worker is one who is
“actively” “ ‘engaged in transportation’ of . . .
goods across borders via the channels of foreign or interstate
commerce.” 596 U. S., at 458 (quoting Circuit City, 532
U. S., at 121). In other words, any exempt worker “must at
least play a direct and ‘necessary role in the free flow of goods’
across borders.” 596 U. S., at 458 (quoting Circuit
City, 532 U. S., at 121). These requirements
“undermine[ ] any attempt to give the provision a sweeping,
open-ended construction,” instead limiting §1 to its appropriately
“narrow” scope. Id., at 118.

															*  *  *

															A transportation worker need not work in the
transportation industry to fall within the exemption from the FAA
provided by §1 of the Act. The Second Circuit accordingly erred in
compelling arbitration on the basis that petitioners work in the
bakery industry. We express no opinion on any alternative grounds
in favor of arbitration raised below, including that petitioners
are not transportation workers and that petitioners are not
“engaged in foreign or interstate commerce” within the meaning of
§1 because they deliver baked goods only in Connecticut.

															The judgment of the Second Circuit is vacated,
and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with
this opinion.

															It is so ordered.

 In addition to Flowers,
two of its subsidiaries, C. K. Sales Co., LLC, and LePage
Bakeries Park St., LLC, are defendants below and respondents here.
We refer to respondents collectively as “Flowers.”

 The Second Circuit did
not address whether Bissonnette and Wojnarowski qualify as
transportation workers based on the work that they perform, or
whether they are “engaged in . . . interstate commerce”
even though they do not drive across state lines. We do not decide
those issues.
