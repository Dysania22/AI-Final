															SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

															SYLVIA GONZALEZ, PETITIONER v. EDWARD
TREVINO, II, et al.

															on writ of certiorari to the united states
court of appeals for the fifth circuit

															[June 20, 2024]

															

															Justice Thomas, dissenting.

															I continue to believe that “plaintiffs bringing
a First Amendment retaliatory-arrest claim under §1983 should have
to plead and prove a lack of probable cause.” Lozman v.
Riviera Beach, 585 U.S. 87, 107 (2018) (Thomas, J.,
dissenting).[1]* Under the
Court’s precedents, §1983 is “construed in light of common-law
principles that were well settled at the time of its enactment.”
Kalina v. Fletcher, 522 U.S.
118, 123 (1997). “Because no common-law tort for retaliatory
arrest in violation of the freedom of speech existed when §1983 was
enacted, we look to the common-law torts that provide the closest
analogy to this claim.” Nieves v. Bartlett, 587 U.S.
391, 409 (2019) (Thomas, J., concurring in part and concurring in
judgment) (internal quotation marks and alteration omitted). As I
have previously explained, the common-law torts most analogous to
retaliatory-arrest claims are false imprisonment, malicious arrest,
and malicious prosecution—all of which required a plaintiff to
prove “the absence of probable cause.” Id., at 409–410.
Gonzalez concedes that there was probable cause for her arrest.
Brief for Petitioner 30. Her retaliatory-arrest claim therefore
cannot proceed.

															Resisting that conclusion, Gonzalez contends
that there is still another common-law analogue for a retaliatory-
arrest claim: abuse of process. Although the exact contours of that
tort are unclear, abuse of process generally addressed the
“extortionate perversion of lawfully initiated process to
illegitimate ends.” Heck v. Humphrey, 512 U.S.
477, 486, n. 5 (1994). Critically for Gonzalez’s argument,
an abuse-of-process claim did not require a plaintiff to establish
the absence of probable cause. See C. Addison, Wrongs and Their
Remedies 601–602 (3d ed. 1870) (Addison); T. Cooley, Law of Torts
356 (3d ed. 1906) (Cooley).

															I am not persuaded that an abuse-of-process
claim is analogous to Gonzalez’s retaliatory-arrest claim.
Gonzalez’s central argument is that her arrest was invalid because
the defendants had an improper motive. As she sees it, even though
the defendants had probable cause to arrest her, they did so only
in retaliation for her constitutionally protected speech. See App.
to Pet. for Cert. 126a, 129a. Abuse of process, however, appeared
to be less concerned with why process was initiated and more with
whether process was ultimately used as “intended by the law.”
Mayer v. Walter, 64 Pa. 283, 285–286 (1870); see
Addison 602 (abuse-of-process tort applies where process has been
“prostituted to an illegal purpose”). An abuse of process occurred
when an ordinary process was distorted “for a purpose not justified
by the law,” and the tort required “ ‘an act in the use of the
process not proper in the regular prosecution of the
proceeding.’ ” Cooley 354–356. For example, a plaintiff could
assert an abuse-of-process claim if an officer arrested and
detained him in an oppressive manner as a means of extortion. See
id., at 354–355 (providing as an example “causing an arrest
. . . and keeping [the plaintiff] imprisoned until, by
stress thereof, he is compelled to surrender property to which the
other is not entitled”). Or, a plaintiff could bring an
abuse-of-process claim if an officer deprived him of food while he
was detained. Wood v. Graves, 144 Mass. 365, 366, 11
N.E. 567, 576 (1887) (describing where a “person arrested
. . . is treated with cruelty, is deprived of proper
food, or is otherwise treated with oppression and undue hardship”).
Either way, the essential question appears to have been how the
process was used—not whether the process was initiated with an
improper motive. See Glidewell v. Murray-Lacy &
Co., 124 Va. 563, 569, 98 S.E. 665, 667 (1919) (explaining that
the “distinctive nature of an action for abuse of process
. . . lies for the improper use of a regularly issued
process, not for maliciously causing process to issue”); Cooley 356
(“ ‘Regular and legitimate use of process, though with a bad
intention, is not a malicious abuse of process’ ”). Because
Gonzalez’s retaliatory-arrest claim focuses on the motives behind
her arrest and not the process itself, the abuse-of-process tort is
a poor fit.

															The Court takes an even more dubious route in
its attempt to salvage Gonzalez’s case. In Nieves v.
Bartlett, the Court correctly recognized that probable cause
precludes a retaliatory-arrest claim. 587 U. S., at 406. But,
it introduced one purportedly “narrow qualification.” Ibid.;
see Lund v. Rockford, 956 F.3d 938, 944 (CA7 2020)
(considering whether a plaintiff ’s “case squeeze[d] through
the crack of an opening that Nieves left ajar”). The
Nieves Court concluded that a plaintiff need not show a lack
of probable cause if he “presents objective evidence that he was
arrested when otherwise similarly situated individuals not engaged
in the same sort of protected speech had not been.” 587 U. S.,
at 407.

															Today, the Court expands that qualification.
Nieves’s exception can now apply if a plaintiff presents
evidence of any objective fact that “makes it more likely
that an officer has declined to arrest someone for engaging in such
conduct in the past.” Ante, at 5 (emphasis deleted).
Accordingly, even though Gonzalez’s proffered evidence does not
point to a single “similarly situated individua[l],” the Court
nonetheless concludes she may satisfy the Nieves exception.
Nieves, 587 U. S., at 407.

															There is “no basis in either the common law or
our First Amendment precedents” for the exception created in
Nieves and expanded upon today. Id., at 409 (opinion
of Thomas, J.). And, the Court should not craft §1983 rules “as a
matter of policy.” Id., at 411. I would adhere to the only
rule grounded in history: Probable cause defeats a
retaliatory-arrest claim. I respectfully dissent.

Notes

*I also remain “skeptical that
42 U. S. C. §1983 recognizes a claim for retaliatory
arrests under the First Amendment.” Lozman, 585 U. S.,
at 104, n. 2 (Thomas, J., dissenting). “Because no party
questions whether §1983 claims for retaliatory arrests under the
First Amendment are actionable, I assume that §1983 permits such
claims.” Nieves v. Bartlett, 587 U.S. 391, 409, n.
(2019) (Thomas, J., concurring in part and concurring in
judgment).
