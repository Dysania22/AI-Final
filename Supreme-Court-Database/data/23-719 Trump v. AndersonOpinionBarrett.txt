															SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

															_________________

															No. 23–719

															_________________

															DONALD J. TRUMP, PETITIONER v. NORMA
ANDERSON, et al.

															on writ of certiorari to the supreme court of
colorado

															[March 4, 2024]

															

															Justice Barrett, concurring in part and
concurring in the judgment.

															I join Parts I and II–B of the Court’s opinion.
I agree that States lack the power to enforce Section 3 against
Presidential candidates. That principle is sufficient to resolve
this case, and I would decide no more than that. This suit was
brought by Colorado voters under state law in state court. It does
not require us to address the complicated question whether federal
legislation is the exclusive vehicle through which Section 3 can be
enforced.

															The majority’s choice of a different path leaves
the remaining Justices with a choice of how to respond. In my
judgment, this is not the time to amplify disagreement with
stridency. The Court has settled a politically charged issue in the
volatile season of a Presidential election. Particularly in this
circumstance, writings on the Court should turn the national
temperature down, not up. For present purposes, our differences are
far less important than our unanimity: All nine Justices agree on
the outcome of this case. That is the message Americans should take
home.
