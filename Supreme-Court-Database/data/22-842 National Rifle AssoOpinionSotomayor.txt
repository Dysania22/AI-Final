															NATIONAL RIFLE ASSOCIATION OF AMERICA,
PETITIONER v. MARIA T. VULLO

															on writ of certiorari to the united states
court of appeals for the second circuit

															[May 30, 2024]

															Justice Sotomayor delivered the opinion of the
Court.

															Six decades ago, this Court held that a
government entity’s “threat of invoking legal sanctions and other
means of coercion” against a third party “to achieve the
suppression” of disfavored speech violates the First Amendment.
Bantam Books, Inc. v. Sullivan, 372 U.S.
58, 67 (1963). Today, the Court reaffirms what it said then:
Government officials cannot attempt to coerce private parties in
order to punish or suppress views that the government disfavors.
Petitioner National Rifle Association (NRA) plausibly alleges that
respondent Maria Vullo did just that. As superintendent of the New
York Department of Financial Services, Vullo allegedly pressured
regulated entities to help her stifle the NRA’s pro-gun advocacy by
threatening enforcement actions against those entities that refused
to disassociate from the NRA and other gun-promotion advocacy
groups. Those allegations, if true, state a First Amendment
claim.

															I

															A

															Because this case comes to us at the
motion-to-dismiss stage, the Court assumes the truth of
“well-pleaded factual allegations” and “reasonable inference[s]”
therefrom. Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556
U.S. 662, 678–679 (2009). Unless stated otherwise, the
allegations aver as follows:

															The New York Department of Financial Services
(DFS) oversees insurance companies and financial services
institutions doing business in the State. See N. Y. Fin.
Servs. Law Ann. §201(a) (West 2012). DFS can initiate
investigations and civil enforcement actions against regulated
entities, and can refer potential criminal violations to the
State’s attorney general for prosecution. §§301(b), (c)(4). The
DFS-regulated entities in this case are insurers that had business
relationships with the NRA.

															Since 2000, the NRA has offered a variety of
insurance programs as a benefit to its members. The NRA contracted
with affiliates of Lockton Companies, LLC (Lockton), to administer
the various policies of these affinity insurance programs, which
Chubb Limited (Chubb) and Lloyd’s of London (Lloyd’s) would then
underwrite. In return, the NRA received a percentage of its
members’ premium payments. One of the NRA’s affinity products,
Carry Guard, covered personal-injury and criminal-defense costs
related to licensed firearm use, and “insured New York residents
for intentional, reckless, and criminally negligent acts with a
firearm that injured or killed another person.” 49 F. 4th 700, 707
(CA2 2022).

															In September 2017, a gun-control advocacy group
contacted the New York County District Attorney’s office to tip
them off to “compliance infirmities in Carry Guard.” App. to Pet.
for Cert. 206, Second Amended Complaint ¶34. That office then
passed on the allegations to DFS. The next month,
then-Superintendent of DFS Vullo began investigating Carry Guard,
focusing on Chubb and Lockton. The investigation revealed at least
two kinds of violations of New York law: that Carry Guard insured
intentional criminal acts, and the NRA promoted Carry Guard without
an insurance producer license. By mid-November, upon finding out
about the investigation following DFS information requests, Lockton
and Chubb suspended Carry Guard. Vullo then expanded her
investigation into the NRA’s other affinity insurance programs,
many of which were underwritten by Lloyd’s and administered by
Lockton. These NRA-endorsed programs provided similar coverage and
suffered from the same legal infirmities.

															In the midst of the investigation, tragedy
struck Parkland, Florida. On February 14, 2018, a gunman opened
fire at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, murdering 17 students
and staff members. Following the shooting, the NRA and other
gun-advocacy groups experienced “intense backlash” across the
country. 49 F. 4th, at 708. Major business institutions, including
DFS-regulated entities, spoke out against the NRA, and some even
cut ties with the organization. App. to Pet. for Cert. 244.
MetLife, for example, ended a discount program it offered with the
NRA. On February 25, 2018, Lockton’s chairman “placed a distraught
telephone call to the NRA,” in which he privately shared that
Lockton would sever all ties with the NRA to avoid “ ‘losing
[its] license’ to do business in New York.” Id., at 298,
Complaint ¶42. Lockton publicly announced its decision the next
day. Following Lockton’s decision, the NRA’s corporate insurance
carrier also severed ties with the organization and refused to
renew coverage at any price. The NRA contends that Lockton and the
corporate insurance carrier took these steps not because of the
Parkland shooting but because they feared “reprisa[l]” from Vullo.
Id., at 210, ¶44; see id., at 209–210, ¶¶41–43.

															Around that time, Vullo also began to meet with
executives at the insurance companies doing business with the NRA.
On February 27, Vullo met with senior executives at Lloyd’s. There,
speaking on behalf of DFS and then-Governor Andrew Cuomo, Vullo
“presented [their] views on gun control and their desire to
leverage their powers to combat the availability of firearms,
including specifically by weakening the NRA.” Id., at 221,
¶67. She also “discussed an array of technical regulatory
infractions plaguing the affinity-insurance marketplace” in New
York. Id., at 199, ¶21. Vullo told the Lloyd’s executives
“that DFS was less interested in pursuing the[se] infractions”
unrelated to any NRA business “so long as Lloyd’s ceased providing
insurance to gun groups, especially the NRA.” Id., at
199–200, ¶21; accord, id., at 223, ¶69 (alleging that Vullo
made it clear to Lloyd’s that it “could avoid liability for
infractions relating to other, similarly situated insurance
policies, so long as it aided DFS’s campaign against gun
groups”).[1] Vullo and Lloyd’s
struck a deal: Lloyd’s “would instruct its syndicates to cease
underwriting firearm-related policies and would scale back its
NRA-related business,” and “in exchange, DFS would focus its
forthcoming affinity-insurance enforcement action solely on those
syndicates which served the NRA, and ignore other syndicates
writing similar policies.” Ibid., ¶69.

															On April 19, 2018, Vullo issued two virtually
identical guidance letters on DFS letterhead entitled, “Guidance on
Risk Management Relating to the NRA and Similar Gun Promotion
Organizations.” Id., at 246–251 (Guidance Letters). Vullo
sent one of the letters to insurance companies and the other to
financial services institutions. In the letters, Vullo pointed to
the “social backlash” against the NRA and other groups “that
promote guns that lead to senseless violence” following “several
recent horrific shootings, including in Parkland, Florida.”
Id., at 246, 249. Vullo then cited recent instances of
businesses severing their ties with the NRA as examples of
companies “fulfilling their corporate social responsibility.”
Id., at 247, 250.

															In the Guidance Letters’ final paragraph, Vullo
“encourage[d]” DFS-regulated entities to: (1) “continue evaluating
and managing their risks, including reputational risks, that may
arise from their dealings with the NRA or similar gun promotion
organizations”; (2) “review any relationships they have with the
NRA or similar gun promotion organizations”; and (3) “take prompt
actions to manag[e] these risks and promote public health and
safety.” Id., at 248, 251.[2]

															The same day that DFS issued the Guidance
Letters, Vullo and Governor Cuomo issued a joint press release that
echoed many of the letters’ statements. The press release included
a quote from Vullo “ ‘urg[ing] all insurance companies and
banks doing business in New York’ ” to join those “ ‘that
have already discontinued their arrangements with the NRA.’ ”
Id., at 244. The press release cited Chubb’s decision to
stop underwriting Carry Guard as an example to emulate. The next
day, Cuomo tweeted: “ ‘The NRA is an extremist organization. I
urge companies in New York State to revisit any ties they have to
the NRA and consider their reputations, and responsibility to the
public.’ ” Id., at 213, Complaint ¶51.

															Less than two weeks after the Guidance Letters
and press release went out, DFS entered into consent decrees with
Lockton (on May 2), and Chubb (on May 7). The decrees stipulated
that Carry Guard violated New York insurance law because it
provided insurance coverage for intentional criminal acts, and
because the NRA promoted Carry Guard, along with other NRA-endorsed
programs, without an insurance producer license. The decrees also
listed other infractions of the State’s insurance law. Both Lockton
and Chubb admitted liability, agreed not to provide any
NRA-endorsed insurance programs (even if lawful) but were permitted
to sell corporate insurance to the NRA, and agreed to pay fines of
$7 million and $1.3 million respectively. On May 9, Lloyd’s
officially instructed its syndicates to terminate existing
agreements with the NRA and not to insure new ones. It publicly
announced its decision to cut ties with the NRA that same day. On
December 20, 2018, DFS and Lloyd’s entered into their own consent
decree, which imposed similar terms and a $5 million fine.

															B

															The NRA sued Cuomo, Vullo, and DFS. The only
claims before the Court today are those against Vullo—namely,
claims that Vullo violated the First Amendment by coercing
DFS-regulated parties to punish or suppress “the NRA’s pro- Second
Amendment viewpoint” and “core political speech.” Id., at
231, ¶91, 234, ¶101. The complaint asserts both censorship and
retaliation First Amendment claims, which the parties and lower
courts have analyzed together. Vullo moved to dismiss, arguing that
the alleged conduct did not constitute impermissible coercion and
that, in the alternative, she was entitled to qualified immunity
because she did not violate clearly established law.

															The District Court denied Vullo’s motion to
dismiss the NRA’s First-Amendment damages claims. The court held
that the NRA plausibly alleged that “the combination of [Vullo’s
and Cuomo’s] actions . . . could be interpreted as a
veiled threat to regulated industries to disassociate with the NRA
or risk DFS enforcement action.” NRA of Am. v. Cuomo,
525 F. Supp. 3d 382, 402–403 (NDNY 2021). That threat, the
court said, crossed a First Amendment line. The District Court
concluded that Vullo was not entitled to qualified immunity at the
motion-to-dismiss stage.

															The Second Circuit reversed. It concluded that
Vullo’s alleged actions constituted permissible government speech
and legitimate law enforcement, and not unconstitutional coercion.
The Second Circuit determined that the Guidance Letters and
accompanying press release were not unconstitutionally coercive
because they “were written in an even-handed, nonthreatening tone
and employed words intended to persuade rather than intimidate.” 49
F. 4th, at 717. The court found it significant that Vullo “did not
refer to any pending investigations or possible regulatory action”
and alluded only to business-related risks “amid growing public
concern over gun violence.” Ibid. As for Vullo’s meeting
with the Lloyd’s executives, the court admitted that the
allegations presented a “closer call.” Id., at 718.
Nonetheless, just as with the consent decrees, it found that Vullo
“was merely carrying out her regulatory responsibilities.”
Id., at 718–719. The Second Circuit also held that, even if
the complaint stated a First Amendment violation, the law was not
clearly established, and so Vullo was entitled to qualified
immunity.

															The NRA filed a petition for a writ of
certiorari, seeking either summary reversal or review of the First
Amendment and qualified immunity holdings. This Court granted
certiorari on only the first question presented whether the
complaint states a First Amendment claim against Vullo. See 601
U. S. ___ (2023).[3]

															II

															As discussed below, Vullo was free to
criticize the NRA and pursue the conceded violations of New York
insurance law. She could not wield her power, however, to threaten
enforcement actions against DFS-regulated entities in order to
punish or suppress the NRA’s gun-promotion advocacy. Because the
complaint plausibly alleges that Vullo did just that, the Court
holds that the NRA stated a First Amendment violation.

															A

															At the heart of the First Amendment’s Free
Speech Clause is the recognition that viewpoint discrimination is
uniquely harmful to a free and democratic society. The Clause
prohibits government entities and actors from “abridging the
freedom of speech.” When government officials are “engaging in
their own expressive conduct,” though, “the Free Speech Clause has
no application.” Pleasant Grove City v. Summum,
555 U.S.
460, 467 (2009). The government can “ ‘say what it
wishes’ ” and “select the views that it wants to express.”
Id., at 467–468 (quoting Rosenberger v. Rector and
Visitors of Univ. of Va., 515 U.S.
819, 833 (1995)). That makes sense; the government could barely
function otherwise. “When a government entity embarks on a course
of action, it necessarily takes a particular viewpoint and rejects
others,” and thus does not need to “maintain viewpoint-neutrality
when its officers and employees speak about that venture.”
Matal v. Tam, 582 U.S. 218, 234 (2017).

															A government official can share her views freely
and criticize particular beliefs, and she can do so forcefully in
the hopes of persuading others to follow her lead. In doing so, she
can rely on the merits and force of her ideas, the strength of her
convictions, and her ability to inspire others. What she cannot do,
however, is use the power of the State to punish or suppress
disfavored expression. See Rosenberger, 515 U. S., at
830 (explaining that governmental actions seeking to suppress a
speaker’s particular views are presumptively unconstitutional). In
such cases, it is “the application of state power which we are
asked to scrutinize.” NAACP v. Alabama ex rel.
Patterson, 357 U.S.
449, 463 (1958).

															In Bantam Books, this Court explored the
distinction between permissible attempts to persuade and
impermissible attempts to coerce. There, a state commission used
its power to investigate and recommend criminal prosecution to
censor publications that, in its view, were
“ ‘objectionable’ ” because they threatened “youthful
morals.” 372 U. S., at 59–62, 71. The commission sent official
notices to a distributor for blacklisted publications that
highlighted the commission’s “duty to recommend to the Attorney
General” violations of the State’s obscenity laws. Id., at
62–63, and n. 5. The notices also informed the distributor
that the lists of blacklisted publications “were circulated to
local police departments,” and that the distributor’s cooperation
in removing the publications from the shelves would
“ ‘eliminate the necessity’ ” of any referral for
prosecution. Ibid. A local police officer also conducted
followup visits to ensure compliance. In response, the distributor
took “steps to stop further circulation of copies of the listed
publications” out of fear of facing “ ‘a court action.’ ”
Id., at 63.

															The publishers of the blacklisted publications
sued the commission, alleging that this scheme of informal
censorship violated their First Amendment rights. The commission
responded that “it d[id] not regulate or suppress obscenity but
simply exhort[ed] booksellers and advise[d] them of their legal
rights.”Id., at 66. This Court sided with the publishers,
holding that the commission violated their free-speech rights by
coercing the distributor to stop selling and displaying the listed
publications.

															The Court explained that the First Amendment
prohibits government officials from relying on the “threat of
invoking legal sanctions and other means of coercion
. . . to achieve the suppression” of disfavored speech.
Id., at 67. Although the commission lacked the “power to
apply formal legal sanctions,” the distributor “reasonably
understood” the commission to threaten adverse action, and thus the
distributor’s “compliance with the [c]ommission’s directives was
not voluntary.” Id., at 66–68. To reach this conclusion, the
Court considered things like: the commission’s coordination with
law enforcement and its authority to refer matters for prosecution;
the notices themselves, which were “phrased virtually as orders”
containing “thinly veiled threats to institute criminal
proceedings” if the distributor did not come around; and the
distributor’s reaction to the notices and followup visits.
Id., at 68.

															Since Bantam Books, the Courts of Appeals
have considered similar factors to determine whether a challenged
communication is reasonably understood to be a coercive threat.
Take the decision below, for example. The Second Circuit purported
to consider: “(1) word choice and tone; (2) the existence of
regulatory authority; (3) whether the speech was perceived as a
threat; and, perhaps most importantly, (4) whether the speech
refers to adverse consequences.” 49 F. 4th, at 715 (citations
omitted).[4] Other Circuits
have taken similarly fact-intensive approaches, utilizing a
multifactor test or a totality-of-the-circumstances analysis. See,
e.g., Missouri v. Biden, 83 F. 4th 350,
380 (CA5 2023) (“[T]o help distinguish permissible persuasion from
impermissible coercion, we turn to the Second (and Ninth) Circuit’s
four-factor test”); Kennedy v. Warren, 66 F. 4th
1199, 1207 (CA9 2023) (applying the Second Circuit’s “useful
non-exclusive four-factor framework”); Backpage.com, LLC v.
Dart, 807 F.3d 229, 230–232 (CA7 2015) (considering the same
factors as part of a totality-of-the-circumstances analysis);
R. C. Maxwell Co. v. New Hope, 735 F.2d 85, 88
(CA3 1984) (same). The Courts of Appeals that employ a multifactor
test agree that “[n]o one factor is dispositive.” 49 F. 4th, at
715; accord, Kennedy, 66 F. 4th, at 1210 (explaining that
the absence of direct regulatory authority is not dispositive).

															Ultimately, Bantam Books stands for the
principle that a government official cannot do indirectly what she
is barred from doing directly: A government official cannot coerce
a private party to punish or suppress disfavored speech on her
behalf. See, e.g., 372 U. S., at 67–69; see also
Backpage.com, 807 F. 3d, at 231 (holding that the First
Amendment barred a sheriff from “using the power of his office to
threaten legal sanctions against . . . credit-card
companies for facilitating future speech”); Okwedy v.
Molinari, 
333 F.3d 339, 344 (CA2 2003) (per curiam) (holding
that a religious group stated a First Amendment claim against a
borough president who wrote a letter “contain[ing] an implicit
threat of retaliation” against a billboard company displaying the
group’s disfavored message); cf. Penthouse Int’l, Ltd. v.
Meese, 939 F. 2d, 1011, 1016 (CADC 1991) (“[W]hen the
government threatens no sanction—criminal or otherwise—we very much
doubt that the government’s criticism or effort to embarrass the
[intermediary] threatens anyone’s First Amendment rights”).

															B

															The parties and the Solicitor General, who
filed an amicus brief supporting vacatur, agree that
Bantam Books provides the right analytical framework for
claims that the government has coerced a third party to violate the
First Amendment rights of another. They also embrace the lower
courts’ multifactor test as a useful, though nonexhaustive, guide.
Rightly so. Considerations like who said what and how, and what
reaction followed, are just helpful guideposts in answering the
question whether an official seeks to persuade or, instead, to
coerce. Where the parties differ is on the application of the
Bantam Books framework. The NRA and the Solicitor General
reject the Second Circuit’s application of the framework, while
Vullo defends it. The Court now agrees with the NRA and the
Solicitor General.

															To state a claim that the government violated
the First Amendment through coercion of a third party, a plaintiff
must plausibly allege conduct that, viewed in context, could be
reasonably understood to convey a threat of adverse government
action in order to punish or suppress the plaintiff ’s speech.
See 372 U. S., at 67–68. Accepting the well-pleaded factual
allegations in the complaint as true, the NRA plausibly alleged
that Vullo violated the First Amendment by coercing DFS-regulated
entities into disassociating with the NRA in order to punish or
suppress the NRA’s gun-promotion advocacy.

															Consider first Vullo’s authority, which serves
as a backdrop to the NRA’s allegations of coercion. The power that
a government official wields, while certainly not dispositive, is
relevant to the objective inquiry of whether a reasonable person
would perceive the official’s communication as coercive. See
id., at 66–67. Generally speaking, the greater and more
direct the government official’s authority, the less likely a
person will feel free to disregard a directive from the official.
For example, imagine a local affinity group in New York that
receives a strongly worded letter. One would reasonably expect that
organization to react differently if the letter came from, say, the
U. S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York than if
it came from an out-of-state school board.

															As DFS superintendent, Vullo had direct
regulatory and enforcement authority over all insurance companies
and financial service institutions doing business in New York. See
N. Y. Fin. Servs. Law Ann. §§202, 301. Just like the
commission in Bantam Books, Vullo could initiate
investigations and refer cases for prosecution. Indeed, she could
do much more than that. Vullo also had the power to notice civil
charges and, as this case shows, enter into consent decrees that
impose significant monetary penalties.

															Against this backdrop, consider Vullo’s
communications with the DFS-regulated entities, particularly with
Lloyd’s. According to the NRA, Vullo brought a variety of
insurance-law violations to the Lloyd’s executives’ attention
during a private meeting in February 2018. The violations included
technical infractions that allegedly plagued the affinity insurance
market in New York and that were unrelated to any NRA business.
App. to Pet. for Cert. 199–200, Complaint ¶21; accord, id.,
at 207–208, ¶¶36–37; id., at 223, ¶69. Vullo allegedly said
she would be “less interested in pursuing the[se] infractions
. . . so long as Lloyd’s ceased providing insurance to
gun groups, especially the NRA.” Id., at 199–200, ¶21. Vullo
therefore wanted Lloyd’s to disassociate from all gun groups,
although there was no indication that such groups had unlawful
insurance policies similar to the NRA’s. Vullo also told the
Lloyd’s executives she would “focus” her enforcement actions
“solely” on the syndicates with ties to the NRA, “and ignore other
syndicates writing similar policies.” Id., at 223, ¶69. The
message was therefore loud and clear: Lloyd’s “could avoid
liability for [unrelated] infractions” if it “aided DFS’s campaign
against gun groups” by terminating its business relationships with
them. Ibid.

															As alleged, Vullo’s communications with Lloyd’s
can be reasonably understood as a threat or as an inducement.
Either of those can be coercive. As Vullo concedes, the “threat
need not be explicit,” Brief for Respondent 47, and as the
Solicitor General explains, “[t]he Constitution does not
distinguish between ‘comply or I’ll prosecute’ and ‘comply and I’ll
look the other way,’ ” Brief for United States as Amicus
Curiae 18, n. 7. So, whether analyzed as a threat or as an
inducement, the conclusion is the same: Vullo allegedly coerced
Lloyd’s by saying she would ignore unrelated infractions and focus
her enforcement efforts on NRA-related business alone, if Lloyd’s
ceased underwriting NRA policies and disassociated from
gun-promotion groups.

															The reaction from Lloyd’s further confirms the
communications’ coercive nature. Cf. Bantam Books, 372
U. S., at 63, 68 (noting that the distributor’s “reaction on
receipt of a notice was to take steps to stop further circulation
of copies of the listed publications”). At the meeting itself,
Lloyd’s “agreed that it would instruct its syndicates to cease
underwriting firearm-related policies and would scale back its
NRA-related business.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 223, Complaint ¶69.
Minutes from a subsequent board of directors’ meeting reveal that
Lloyd’s thought “the DFS investigation had transformed the gun
issue into ‘a regulatory, legal[,] and compliance matter.’ ” 2
App. to Pet. for Cert. 29 (Sealed). That reaction is consistent
with Lloyd’s public announcement that it had directed its
syndicates to “terminate all insurance related to the NRA and not
to provide any insurance to the NRA in the future.” App. to Pet.
for Cert. 224, Complaint ¶72; accord, id., at 306, ¶20
(consent decree memorializing commitment not to underwrite, or
participate in, NRA-endorsed programs).

															Other allegations, viewed in context, reinforce
the NRA’s First Amendment claim. Consider the April 2018 Guidance
Letters and accompanying press release, which Vullo issued on
official letterhead. Cf. Bantam Books, 372 U. S., at
61–63, and n. 5 (discussing notice issued in “official
Commission stationery”). Just like in her meeting with the Lloyd’s
executives, here too Vullo singled out the NRA and other
gun-promotion organizations as the targets of her call to action.
This time, the Guidance Letters reminded DFS-regulated entities of
their obligation to consider their “reputational risks,” and then
tied that obligation to an encouragement for “prompt actio[n] to
manag[e] these risks.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 248, 251. Evocative
of Vullo’s private conversation with the Lloyd’s executives a few
weeks earlier, the press release revealed how to manage the risks
by encouraging DFS-regulated entities to “ ‘discontinu[e]
their arrangements with the NRA,’ ” just like Chubb did when
it stopped underwriting Carry Guard. App. to Pet. for Cert. 244. A
follow-on tweet from Cuomo reaffirmed the message: Businesses in
New York should “ ‘consider their reputations’ ” and
“ ‘revisit any ties they have to the NRA,’ ” which he
called “ ‘an extremist organization.’ ” Id., at
213, ¶51.

															In sum, the complaint, assessed as a whole,
plausibly alleges that Vullo threatened to wield her power against
those refusing to aid her campaign to punish the NRA’s
gun-promotion advocacy. If true, that violates the First
Amendment.

															C

															In holding otherwise, the Second Circuit found
that: (1) the “Guidance Letters and Press Release are clear
examples of permissible government speech”; and (2) the Lloyd’s
meeting was “legitimate enforcement action” in which Vullo was
“merely carrying out her regulatory responsibilities” by offering
“leniency in the course of negotiating a resolution of the apparent
insurance law violations.” 49 F. 4th, at 717–719. The Second
Circuit could only reach this conclusion by taking the allegations
in isolation and failing to draw reasonable inferences in the NRA’s
favor in violation of this Court’s precedents. Cf. Iqbal,
556 U. S., at 678–679; Bell Atlantic Corp. v.
Twombly, 550 U.S.
544, 570 (2007).

															For example, the Second Circuit failed to
analyze the Guidance Letters and press release against the backdrop
of other allegations in the complaint, including the Lloyd’s
meeting. Moreover, as discussed above, the complaint alleges that
Vullo made a not-so-subtle, sanctions-backed threat to Lloyd’s to
cut all business ties with the NRA and other gun-promotion groups,
although there was no sign that other gun groups also had unlawful
insurance policies. See supra, at 13. It is also relevant
that Vullo made this alleged threat in a meeting where she
presented her “desire to leverage [her] powers to combat the
availability of firearms, including specifically by weakening the
NRA.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 221, Complaint ¶67; id., at
223, ¶69 (alleging Vullo hoped to enlist DFS-regulated entities in
“aid[ing] DFS’s campaign against gun groups”). Given the obligation
to draw reasonable inferences in the NRA’s favor and consider the
allegations as a whole, the Second Circuit erred in reading the
complaint as involving only individual instances of “permissible
government speech” and the execution of Vullo’s “regulatory
responsibilities.” 49 F. 4th, at 717–719.

															For the same reasons, this Court cannot simply
credit Vullo’s assertion that “pursuing conceded violations of the
law,” Brief for Respondent 29, is an “ ‘obvious alternative
explanation’ ” for her actions that defeats the plausibility
of any coercive threat raising First Amendment concerns,
id., at 37, 40, 42 (quoting Iqbal, 556 U. S., at
682). Of course, discovery in this case might show that the
allegations of coercion are false, or that certain actions should
be understood differently in light of newly disclosed evidence. At
this stage, though, the Court must assume the well-pleaded factual
allegations in the complaint are true.[5]

															Moreover, the conceded illegality of the
NRA-endorsed insurance programs does not insulate Vullo from First
Amendment scrutiny under the Bantam Books framework. Indeed,
the commission in that case targeted the distribution and display
of material that, in its view, violated the State’s obscenity laws.
Nothing in that case turned on the distributor’s compliance with
state law. On the contrary, Bantam Books held that the
commission violated the First Amendment by invoking legal sanctions
to suppress disfavored publications, some of which may or may not
contain protected speech (i.e., nonobscene material).
See 372 U. S., at 64, 67. Here, too, although Vullo can pursue
violations of state insurance law, she cannot do so in order to
punish or suppress the NRA’s protected expression. So, the
contention that the NRA and the insurers violated New York law does
not excuse Vullo from allegedly employing coercive threats to
stifle gun-promotion advocacy.

															Vullo next argues that this case does not
involve unconstitutional coercion because her challenged actions in
fact targeted business practices and relationships, which qualify
as “nonexpressive activity.” Brief for Respondent 32. The argument
is misplaced. That Vullo “regulate[d]” business activities stemming
from the NRA’s “relationships with insurers and banks,”
ibid., does not change the allegations that her actions were
aimed at punishing or suppressing speech. In Bantam Books,
the commission interfered with the business relationship between
the distributor and the publishers in order to suppress the
publishers’ disfavored speech. 372 U. S., at 66–71. Similarly,
in Backpage.com, a sheriff interfered with a website’s
business relationships with payments-service providers in order to
eliminate the website’s “adult section” (if not the website
itself ). 807 F. 3d, at 230–232, 235–236. In that case,
the sheriff wanted to “suffocat[e]” the website, “depriving the
company of ad revenues by scaring off its payments-service
providers.” Id., at 231. “The analogy,” the Seventh Circuit
explained, “is to killing a person by cutting off his oxygen supply
rather than by shooting him.” Ibid. So too here. One can
reasonably infer from the complaint that Vullo coerced
DFS-regulated entities to cut their ties with the NRA in order to
stifle the NRA’s gun-promotion advocacy and advance her views on
gun control. See, e.g., supra, at 12–15; App.
to Pet. for Cert. 221, 230–235, Complaint ¶¶67, 87–105. Vullo knew,
after all, that the NRA relied on insurance and financing “to
disseminate its message.” Id., at 231, ¶92; see id.,
at 203–204, ¶¶28–29.[6]

															Lastly, Vullo falls back on the argument that a
ruling in the NRA’s favor would interfere with the government’s
ability to function properly. She claims that the NRA’s position,
if accepted, would stifle government speech and hamper legitimate
enforcement efforts. This argument falls flat for the simple reason
that it requires the Court to accept Vullo’s limited reading of the
complaint. The Court does not break new ground in deciding this
case. It only reaffirms the general principle from Bantam
Books that where, as here, the complaint plausibly alleges
coercive threats aimed at punishing or suppressing disfavored
speech, the plaintiff states a First Amendment claim.

															III

															The NRA’s allegations, if true, highlight the
constitutional concerns with the kind of intermediary strategy that
Vullo purportedly adopted to target the NRA’s advocacy. Such a
strategy allows government officials to “expand their regulatory
jurisdiction to suppress the speech of organizations that they have
no direct control over.” Brief for First Amendment Scholars as
Amici Curiae Supporting Petitioner 8. It also allows
government officials to be more effective in their
speech-suppression efforts “[b]ecause intermediaries will often be
less invested in the speaker’s message and thus less likely to risk
the regulator’s ire.” Ibid. The allegations here bear this
out. Although “the NRA was not even the directly regulated party,”
Brief for Respondent 32, Vullo allegedly used the power of her
office to target gun promotion by going after the NRA’s business
partners. Insurers in turn followed Vullo’s lead, fearing
regulatory hostility.

															Nothing in this case gives advocacy groups like
the NRA a “right to absolute immunity from [government]
investigation,” or a “right to disregard [state or federal] laws.”
Patterson, 357 U. S., at 463. Similarly, nothing here
prevents government officials from forcefully condemning views with
which they disagree. For those permissible actions, the
Constitution “relies first and foremost on the ballot box, not on
rules against viewpoint discrimination, to check the government
when it speaks.” Shurtleff v. Boston, 596 U.S. 243,
252 (2022). Yet where, as here, a government official makes
coercive threats in a private meeting behind closed doors, the
“ballot box” is an especially poor check on that official’s
authority. Ultimately, the critical takeaway is that the First
Amendment prohibits government officials from wielding their power
selectively to punish or suppress speech, directly or (as alleged
here) through private intermediaries.

															*  *  *

															For the reasons discussed above, the Court
holds that the NRA plausibly alleged that Vullo violated the First
Amendment by coercing DFS-regulated entities to terminate their
business relationships with the NRA in order to punish or suppress
the NRA’s advocacy.

															The judgment of the U. S. Court of Appeals
for the Second Circuit is vacated, and the case remanded for
further proceedings consistent with this opinion.[7]

															It is so ordered.

Notes

 According to the
complaint, other affinity organizations offered similar insurance
policies, including the New York State Bar Association, the New
York City Bar, and the New York State Psychological Association,
among others. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 207–208, Complaint
¶36.

 The financial-regulatory
term “reputational risk” is “ ‘the risk to current or
projected financial condition and resilience arising from negative
public opinion,’ which ‘may impair a bank’s competitiveness by
affecting its ability to establish new relationships or services or
continue servicing existing relationships.’ ” Brief for United
States as Amicus Curiae 27–28, and n. 10 (quoting
Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, Comptroller’s Handbook,
Examination Process, Bank Supervision Process 28 (Sept. 2019)). DFS
monitors the reputational risk of regulated institutions because of
its potential effect on market stability. See Brief for Respondent
6.

 Vullo argues that the
Court must dismiss the case as improvidently granted because the
Court deprived itself of jurisdiction by limiting its review to the
First Amendment question and declining to review the Second
Circuit’s alternative holding that Vullo is entitled to qualified
immunity. See Brief for Respondent 21–24. Not so. In this case,
“[a]n order limiting the grant of certiorari does not operate as a
jurisdictional bar.” Piper Aircraft Co. v. Reyno,
454 U.S.
235, 247, n. 12 (1981). Because the Second Circuit is free
to revisit the qualified immunity question in light of this Court’s
opinion, the NRA still could obtain “ ‘effectual
relief ’ ” on remand. Chafin v. Chafin,
568 U.S.
165, 172 (2013). In such circumstances, it cannot be said that
the resolution of the First Amendment question is merely
advisory.

 The NRA posits a
three-factor test that looks to: (1) the actor’s authority; (2) the
content and purpose of the actor’s communications; and (3) the
reactions of the recipient. Brief for Petitioner 26. The NRA
concedes, however, that its test is the same as the Second
Circuit’s, as it considers the fourth factor in the Second
Circuit’s test of “ ‘whether the speech refers to adverse
consequences’ ” to be an “aspect of the inquiry into the
content and purpose of the communication.” Id., at 27,
n. 8.
5
 Vullo also argues that
she is entitled to absolute prosecutorial immunity for her
enforcement actions. See Brief for Respondent 25–28. Putting aside
whether a financial regulator like Vullo is entitled to such
immunity in the administrative context, because Vullo did not raise
this defense below with respect to the First Amendment claim (or
even with respect to allegations unrelated to the consent decrees),
the Court declines to consider that argument here in the first
instance.

 Vullo’s boss, Governor
Cuomo, also urged businesses to disassociate with the NRA to put
the organization “into financial jeopardy” and “shut them down.”
App. 21 (Aug. 3, 2018, tweet).

 On remand, the Second
Circuit is free to reconsider whether Vullo is entitled to
qualified immunity.
