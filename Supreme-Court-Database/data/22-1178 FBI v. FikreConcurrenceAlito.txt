															SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

															_________________

															No. 22–1178

															_________________

															FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION, et al.,
PETITIONERS v. YONAS FIKRE

															on writ of certiorari to the united states
court of appeals for the ninth circuit

															[March 19, 2024]

															

															Justice Alito, with whom Justice Kavanaugh
joins, concurring.

															I join the Court’s opinion, but write to clarify
my understanding that our decision does not suggest that the
Government must disclose classified information to Mr. Fikre, his
attorney, or a court to show that this case is moot. In at least
some instances, requiring the Government to disclose sensitive
information regarding its grounds for placing or removing a person
from the No-Fly List could undermine the Government’s significant
interests in airline safety and the prevention of terrorist
attacks. Indeed, some of the Nation’s 600-plus district courts are
poorly positioned to handle classified documents, and most court
personnel lack security clearance. Recognizing such limitations, I
do not understand the Court’s opinion to require the Government to
disclose classified information as a matter of course. On the
contrary, non-classified information or information obtained in
discovery from the plaintiff in this and other cases may be
sufficient to show that the allegedly unlawful listing is unlikely
to recur, thereby proving mootness.
