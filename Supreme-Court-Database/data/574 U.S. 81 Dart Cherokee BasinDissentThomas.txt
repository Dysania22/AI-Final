															SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

PETITIONERS v. BRANDON W. OWENS

															on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for
the tenth circuit

															[December 15, 2014]

															Justice Thomas, dissenting.

															I agree with Justice Scalia that the merits of the District
Court’s decision are not properly before the Court. I write only to
point out another, more fundamental, defect in the Court’s
disposition: We lack jurisdiction to review even the Court of
Appeals’ denial of permission to appeal.

															Congress has granted this Court jurisdiction to review “[c]ases
in the courts of appeals” by writ of certiorari.28
U. S. C. §1254. Purporting to act pursuant to this grant
of jurisdiction, the majority today reviews the decision of the
Court of Appeals to deny an application for permission to appeal a
remand order. But such an application is not a case: It
“ ‘does not assert a grievance against anyone, does not seek
remedy or redress for any legal injury, and does not even require a
“party” on the other side.’ ” Miller-El v.
Cockrell,537 U. S. 322,355 (2003) (Thomas, J., dissenting)
(quoting Hohn v. United States,524 U. S. 236,256
(1998) (Scalia, J., dissenting)).

															To justify its action here, the majority quietly extends an
opinion of this Court holding that applications for certificates of
appealability (COAs) in the federal habeas context are “cases.”
Hohn, supra. Hohn was wrongly decided, and the
majority’s uncritical extension of its holding only compounds the
error. Hohn rests tenuously on the conclusion that the
determination that must be made on an application for a COA is more
like a threshold determination than a separate judicial proceeding.
See id., at 246–248. The basis for that conclusion, if any
exists, must rest on features unique to the COA: “The COA
determination . . . requires an overview of the
claims in the habeas petition and a general assessment of their
merits.” Miller-El, supra, at 336 (emphasis added).
The best argument one could make in favor of Hohn is that,
because a court’s decision on an application for a COA turns on the
strength of the applicant’s grievance and his entitlement to
relief, the application absorbs the case-like qualities of the
underlying merits case. See Hohn, supra, at 248.

															No such osmosis could transform an application for permission to
appeal a remand order into a “case.” As Justice Scalia explains,
the decision whether to permit such an appeal requires no
assessment of the merits of a remand order. See ante, at 2
(dissenting opinion). The application here is nothing more than a
request for discretionary permission to seek review. See
Miller-El, supra, at 355 (Thomas, J., dissenting).
The Tenth Circuit having denied that permission, no “case” ever
arrived “in the court of appeals.” I would dismiss for lack of
jurisdiction.
