															SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

															VIVEK H. MURTHY, SURGEON GENERAL, et al.
v. MISSOURI, et al.

															on motion for leave to intervene

															No. 23–411. Decided December 11, 2023

															The motion of the Kennedy Plaintiffs for leave
to intervene is denied.

															Justice Alito, dissenting from the denial of
the motion to intervene.

															Although intervention in this Court is
reserved for unusual circumstances, see S. Shapiro, K. Geller, T.
Bishop, E. Hartnett, D. Himmelfarb, Supreme Court Practice §
6.16(c), p. 6–62 (11th ed. 2019), I would grant the motion now
before us. Allowing intervention would not unduly prejudice the
parties, but the denial of intervention may cause irreparable harm
to the movant.

															This case concerns what two lower courts found
to be a “coordinated campaign” by high-level federal officials to
suppress the expression of disfavored views on social media
platforms that now serve as the primary source of news about
important public issues for many Americans. Missouri v.
Biden, 83 F. 4th 350, 392 (CA5 2023). One of the
alleged victims of this campaign is Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., who is
a candidate for President of the United States. The District Court
found that Government officials have asked social media platforms
to block Mr. Kennedy’s efforts to communicate with the public and
that the platforms have complied. See Missouri v.
Biden, ___ F. Supp. 3d ___, ___, 2023 WL 4335270, *5,
*9, *40 (WD La., July 4, 2023). Mr. Kennedy brought a suit similar
to the one now before us, but his case is stuck in the District
Court, which will not rule on his motion for a preliminary
injunction until we decide this case. See Missouri v.
Biden, 2023 WL 4721172, *2 (WD La., July 24, 2023). Mr.
Kennedy has therefore moved to intervene here to protect his
rights.

															Because Mr. Kennedy’s arguments on the merits
are essentially the same as respondents’, allowing intervention
would not significantly affect petitioners’ burden with regard to
that issue. But the denial of intervention is likely to prevent Mr.
Kennedy from vindicating the rights he claims until the spring of
2024 and perhaps as late as June of that year. And by that time,
several months of the Presidential campaign will have passed.

															In fact, denying intervention may prevent Mr.
Kennedy from obtaining redress for an even longer period. In
successfully arguing that we should stay the preliminary injunction
entered below, the Government contended strenuously that
respondents lack standing. If the Court ultimately agrees with that
argument and orders that this case be dismissed, our decision will
provide little guidance for deciding Mr. Kennedy’s case, and Mr.
Kennedy will be required to wait until the District Court
separately assesses his claims.

															In addition, allowing Mr. Kennedy to intervene
would ensure that we can reach the First Amendment issues,
notwithstanding the Government’s contention that respondents lack
standing. Indeed, because Mr. Kennedy has been mentioned explicitly
in communications between the Government and social media
platforms, he has a strong claim to standing, and the Government
has not argued otherwise.

															Our democratic form of government is undermined
if Government officials prevent a candidate for high office from
communicating with voters, and such efforts are especially
dangerous when the officials engaging in such conduct are
answerable to a rival candidate. I would allow him to intervene to
ensure that we can reach the merits of respondents’ claims and to
prevent the irreparable loss of his First Amendment rights.
