​
The Attorney General (Randolph) moved, on behalf of the plaintiffs, that a commission should issue to examine witnesses in Holland; to which the opposite counsel assented, although the commissioners were not named.
But, by the Court:—We will not award the commission, ’till commissioners are named.
This being done, the motion was granted.
