															TREVOR MURRAY, PETITIONER v. UBS
SECURITIES, LLC, et al.

															on writ of certiorari to the united states
court of appeals for the second circuit

															[February 8, 2024]

															Justice Sotomayor delivered the opinion of the
Court.

															Under the whistleblower-protection provision of
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, no covered employer may “discharge,
demote, suspend, threaten, harass, or in any other manner
discriminate against an employee in the terms and conditions of
employment because of ” protected whistleblowing activity. 18
U. S. C. §1514A(a). When a whistleblower invokes this
provision, he bears the initial burden of showing that his
protected activity “was a contributing factor in the unfavorable
personnel action alleged in the complaint.” 49 U. S. C.
§42121(b)(2)(B)(iii). The burden then shifts to the employer to
show that it “would have taken the same unfavorable personnel
action in the absence of ” the protected activity.
§42121(b)(2)(B)(iv).

															The question before this Court is whether the
phrase “discriminate against an employee . . . because
of ” in §1514A(a) requires a whistleblower additionally to
prove that his employer acted with “retaliatory intent.” Below, the
Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit endorsed such a
requirement. This Court disagrees.

															I

															Congress enacted the Sarbanes-Oxley Act in the
wake of the Enron scandal to “ ‘prevent and punish corporate
and criminal fraud, protect the victims of such fraud, preserve
evidence of such fraud, and hold wrongdoers accountable for their
actions.’ ” Lawson v. FMR LLC, 571 U.S.
429, 434 (2014) (quoting S. Rep. No. 107–146, p. 2
(2002) (hereinafter S. Rep.)). “Of particular concern to
Congress was abundant evidence that Enron had succeeded in
perpetuating its massive shareholder fraud in large part due to a
‘corporate code of silence’ ” that “ ‘discourage[d]
employees from reporting fraudulent behavior not only to the proper
authorities, such as the FBI and the SEC, but even
internally.’ ” 571 U. S., at 435 (quoting S. Rep.,
at 4–5; alteration in original). Indeed, employees of Enron who had
attempted to report corporate misconduct internally were often
fired.

															Congress’ response was 18 U. S. C.
§1514A, which prohibits publicly traded companies from retaliating
against employees who report what they reasonably believe to be
instances of criminal fraud or securities law violations. The
provision establishes that no employer may “discharge, demote,
suspend, threaten, harass, or in any other manner discriminate
against an employee in the terms and conditions of employment
because of ” the employee’s protected whistleblowing activity.
§1514A(a). If an employer violates this provision, the employee can
file a complaint with the Department of Labor seeking
reinstatement, back pay, compensation, and other relief.
§§1514A(b)(1)(A), (c). If there is no final decision from the
Secretary of Labor within 180 days, the employee can file suit in
federal court seeking the same relief. §§1514A(b)(1)(B), (c).

															If the whistleblower does bring an action in
federal court, Sarbanes-Oxley directs the court to apply the “legal
burdens of proof set forth in section 42121(b) of title 49, United
States Code”—a provision of the Wendell H. Ford Aviation Investment
and Reform Act for the 21st Century (AIR 21). §1514A(b)(2)(C). This
incorporated burden-shifting framework provides that the
whistleblower bears the burden to prove that his protected activity
“was a contributing factor in the unfavorable personnel action
alleged in the complaint.” 49 U. S. C.
§42121(b)(2)(B)(i). If the whistleblower makes that showing, the
burden shifts to the employer to show “by clear and convincing
evidence” that it “would have taken the same unfavorable personnel
action in the absence of ” the protected activity.
§42121(b)(2)(B)(ii).

															This framework is not unique to Sarbanes-Oxley
and AIR 21. It originated in the Whistleblower Protection Act of
1989 (WPA), 5 U. S. C. §1221(e), which provides legal
protection for whistleblowers within the civil service. The
framework was meant to relieve whistleblowing employees of the
“excessively heavy burden” under then-existing law of showing that
their protected activity was a “ ‘significant’, ‘motivating’,
‘substantial’, or ‘predominant’ ” factor in the adverse
personnel action, and it reflected a determination that
“[w]histleblowing should never be a factor that contributes in any
way to an adverse personnel action.” 135 Cong. Rec. 5032, 5033
(1989) (Explanatory Statement on S. 20, 101st Cong., 1st Sess.
(1989)). Congress then incorporated the easier-to-satisfy
“contributing factor” framework into a series of similar
whistleblower statutes that protect non-civil-service employees in
industries where whistleblowing plays an especially important role
in protecting the public welfare—including, as noted above, the
airline industry (AIR 21) and the securities industry
(Sarbanes-Oxley).[1]

															II

															In 2011, petitioner Trevor Murray was employed
as a research strategist at securities firm UBS, within the firm’s
commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) business. In that
role, Murray was responsible for reporting on CMBS markets to
current and future UBS customers. Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC) regulations required him to certify that his
reports were produced independently and accurately reflected his
own views. See 17 CFR §242.501(a) (2022). Murray contends that,
despite this requirement of independence, two leaders of the CMBS
trading desk improperly pressured him to skew his reports to be
more supportive of their business strategies, even instructing
Murray to “clear [his] research articles with the desk” before
publishing them. 1 App. in No. 20–4202 (CA2), p. 254.

															Murray reported that conduct to his direct
supervisor, Michael Schumacher, in December 2011 and again in
January 2012, asserting that it was “unethical” and “illegal.” App.
28. Schumacher expressed sympathy for Murray’s situation but
emphasized that it was “very important” that Murray not “alienate
[his] internal client” (i.e., the trading desk).
Ibid. When Murray later informed Schumacher that the
situation with the trading desk “was bad and getting worse,” as he
was being left out of meetings and subjected to “constant efforts
to skew [his] research,” Schumacher told him that he should just
“write what the business line wanted.” Id., at 29–30.
Shortly after that exchange (and despite having given Murray a very
strong performance review just a couple months earlier) Schumacher
emailed his own supervisor and recommended that Murray “be removed
from [UBS’s] head count.” Id., at 39. Schumacher recommended
in the alternative that, if the CMBS trading desk wanted him,
Murray could be transferred to a desk analyst position, where he
would not have SEC certification responsibilities. The trading desk
declined to accept Murray as a transfer, and UBS fired him in
February 2012.

															Murray then filed a complaint with the
Department of Labor alleging that his termination violated §1514A
of Sarbanes-Oxley because he was fired in response to his internal
reporting about fraud on shareholders. When the agency did not
issue a final decision on his complaint within 180 days, Murray
filed an action in federal court.

															Murray’s claim went to trial. UBS moved for
judgment as a matter of law, arguing, among other things, that
Murray had “failed to produce any evidence that Schumacher
possessed any sort of retaliatory animus toward him.” No.
1:14–cv–00927 (SDNY, Dec. 14, 2017), ECF Doc. 244, p. 6. The
District Court denied the motion.

															The District Court instructed the jury that, in
order to prove his §1514A claim, Murray needed to establish four
elements: (1) that he engaged in whistleblowing activity protected
by Sarbanes-Oxley, (2) that UBS knew that he engaged in the
protected activity, (3) that he suffered an adverse employment
action (i.e., was fired), and (4) that his “protected
activity was a contributing factor in the termination of his
employment.” App. 126–127. On the last element, the District Court
further instructed the jury: “For a protected activity to be a
contributing factor, it must have either alone or in combination
with other factors tended to affect in any way UBS’s decision to
terminate [his] employment.” Id., at 130. The court
explained that Murray was “not required to prove that his protected
activity was the primary motivating factor in his termination, or
that . . . UBS’s articulated reason for his termination
was a pretext.” Ibid. If Murray proved each of the four
elements by a preponderance of the evidence, the District Court
instructed, the burden would shift to UBS to “demonstrate by clear
and convincing evidence that it would have terminated [Murray’s]
employment even if he had not engaged in protected activity.”
Ibid.

															During deliberations, the jury asked for
clarification of the contributing-factor instruction. The court
responded that the jury “should consider” whether “anyone with
th[e] knowledge of [Murray’s] protected activity, because of the
protected activity, affect[ed] in any way the decision to terminate
[Murray’s] employment.” Id., at 180. When the court
previewed this response to the parties, UBS indicated that it
“would be comfortable” with that formulation. Id., at
140.

															The jury found that Murray had established his
§1514A claim and that UBS had failed to prove, by clear and
convincing evidence, that it would have fired Murray even if he had
not engaged in protected activity. (In that regard, UBS had argued
to the jury that market-wide difficulties and a $2-billion loss on
a UBS trading desk in London had required the elimination of
certain positions, including Murray’s.) The jury also issued an
advisory verdict on damages, recommending that Murray receive
nearly $1 million.

															After the trial, UBS again moved for judgment as
a matter of law, which the court denied. The court then adopted the
jury’s advisory verdict on damages and awarded an additional $1.769
million in attorney’s fees and costs. UBS appealed the decision,
and Murray cross-appealed on the issues of back pay, reinstatement,
and attorney’s fees.

															The Second Circuit panel vacated the jury’s
verdict and remanded for a new trial. The court identified the
central question as “whether the Sarbanes-Oxley Act’s
antiretaliation provision requires a whistleblower-employee to
prove retaliatory intent,” and, contrary to the trial court, it
concluded that the answer was yes. 43 F. 4th 254, 258 (2022).
The court acknowledged that the jury instructions correctly
identified the four elements of a §1514A claim, consistent with
Circuit precedent. The court concluded, however, that the further
instruction on the contributing-factor element was wrong as a
matter of law.

															Looking to the text of §1514A and focusing in on
the phrase “discriminate . . . because of,” the court
nevertheless held that “to prevail on the ‘contributing factor’
element of a [§1514A] antiretaliation claim, a
whistleblower-employee must prove that the employer took the
adverse employment action against the whistleblower-employee with
retaliatory intent.” Id., at 259–260. The court noted that
this holding was consistent with its recent “interpretation of
nearly identical language in the Federal Railroad Safety Act.”
Id., at 260 (discussing Tompkins v. Metro-North
Commuter R. Co., 983 F.3d 74 (CA2 2020)). The court further
determined that “the district court’s failure to instruct the jury
on Murray’s burden to prove UBS’s retaliatory intent” was not
harmless—despite “circumstantial evidence at trial that UBS
terminated Murray in retaliation for whistleblowing,” such as the
close temporal proximity between Murray’s whistleblowing and
termination and the fact that Schumacher had given Murray a good
performance evaluation prior to his whistleblowing. 43 F. 4th,
at 262. The court concluded that “[r]etaliatory intent is an
element of a section 1514A claim,” and “[t]he district court erred
by failing to instruct the jury on Murray’s burden to prove UBS’s
retaliatory intent.” Id., at 262–263.

															The Second Circuit’s opinion requiring
whistleblowers to prove retaliatory intent placed that Circuit in
direct conflict with the Fifth and Ninth Circuits, which had
rejected any such requirement for §1514A claims. Compare
id., at 262, with Halliburton, Inc. v.
Administrative Review Bd., 771 F.3d 254, 263 (CA5 2014)
(per curiam) (holding that retaliatory intent is not an
element of a §1514A claim); Coppinger-Martin v.
Solis, 627 F.3d 745, 750 (CA9 2010) (same). This Court
granted certiorari to resolve this disagreement. 598 U. S. ___
(2023).

															III

															Section 1514A’s text does not reference or
include a “retaliatory intent” requirement, and the provision’s
mandatory burden-shifting framework cannot be squared with such a
requirement. While a whistleblower bringing a §1514A claim must
prove that his protected activity was a contributing factor in the
unfavorable personnel action, he need not also prove that his
employer acted with “retaliatory intent.”

															Before explaining why a §1514A claim does not
require proof of “retaliatory intent,” it is necessary to
understand what that term means. The Second Circuit seemed to
conceive of “retaliatory intent” as “prejudice” or “animus.” 43
F. 4th, at 259, 261. UBS insists that it means something else,
arguing that “[t]he Second Circuit mentioned ‘animus’ only twice”
and that the Circuit explicitly required “a showing of ‘retaliatory
intent,’ not hostile feelings toward the employee.” Brief for
Respondents 27, n. 3. UBS’s circular definition does not
reveal anything about what “retaliatory intent” means, however, and
UBS itself equated retaliatory intent with “animus” in its briefing
below. See supra, at 5. Thus, consistent with the Second
Circuit’s opinion, this Court treats “retaliatory intent” as
something akin to animus. See also Brief for United States as
Amicus Curiae 16 (suggesting that an employer acts with
“retaliatory intent” “where the employer act[s] out of prejudice,
animus, or comparable hostile or culpable intent”).

															A

															The Second Circuit and UBS both rely heavily
on the word “discriminate” in §1514A to impose a “retaliatory
intent” requirement on whistleblower plaintiffs. As UBS
acknowledges, the Second Circuit’s holding was “expressly
predicated” on the word “discriminate.” Brief in Opposition 11.
That word, however, cannot bear the weight that both the Second
Circuit and UBS place on it.

															Consider the statutory text: No employer subject
to Sarbanes-Oxley “may discharge, demote, suspend, threaten,
harass, or in any other manner discriminate against an employee in
the terms and conditions of employment because of ” the
employee’s protected whistleblowing activity. §1514A(a). To start,
the placement of the word “discriminate” in the section’s catchall
provision suggests that it is meant to capture other adverse
employment actions that are not specifically listed, drawing
meaning from the terms “discharge, demote, suspend, threaten, [and]
harass” rather than imbuing those terms with a new or different
meaning. See, e.g., Brogan v. United
States, 522 U.S.
398, 403, n. 2 (1998) (“[W]hen a general term follows a
specific one, the general term should be understood as a reference
to subjects akin to the one with specific enumeration”). Here,
there is no dispute that Murray was “discharge[d],” and so it is
not obvious that the “or in any other manner discriminate” clause
has any relevance to his claim. According to UBS, though,
“discriminate” in the catchall provision relates back to and
characterizes “discharge,” such that “to be actionable, discharge
must be a ‘manner’ of discriminating.” Brief for Respondents 11.
Accepting this statutory construction argument “for argument’s
sake,” as this Court did in Bostock v. Clayton
County, 590 U.S. 644, 657 (2020), the question is whether the
word “discriminate” inherently requires retaliatory intent. It does
not.

															In Babb v. Wilkie, 589 U.S. 399
(2020), this Court explained that the “normal definition” of
“discrimination” is “differential treatment.” Id., at 405
(quoting Jackson v. Birmingham Bd. of Ed., 544 U.S.
167, 174 (2005); internal quotation marks omitted). In
Bostock, the Court likewise observed that “discriminate”
typically means simply “ ‘[t]o make a difference in treatment
or favor (of one as compared with others).’ ” 590 U. S.,
at 657 (quoting Webster’s New International Dictionary 745 (2d ed.
1954)). Prohibited discrimination occurs when an employer
“intentionally treats a person worse because of ” a protected
characteristic. 590 U. S., at 658. In elaborating on
the meaning of “discriminate,” Bostock made clear that a
lack of “animosity” is “irrelevant” to a claim of discrimination
under Title VII. Id., at 663; see also Automotive
Workers v. Johnson Controls, Inc., 499 U.S.
187, 199 (1991) (explaining that a prohibition on
discrimination “does not depend on why the employer discriminates”
or the presence of “malevolent motive”).

															An animus-like “retaliatory intent” requirement
is simply absent from the definition of the word “discriminate.”
When an employer treats someone worse—whether by firing them,
demoting them, or imposing some other unfavorable change in the
terms and conditions of employment—“because of ” the
employee’s protected whistleblowing activity, the employer violates
§1514A. It does not matter whether the employer was motivated by
retaliatory animus or was motivated, for example, by the belief
that the employee might be happier in a position that did not have
SEC reporting requirements.

															The Second Circuit was wrong when it held that
the word “discriminate” in the statute’s catchall provision imposes
an additional requirement that the whistleblower plaintiff prove
the employer’s “retaliatory intent” or animus. Accepting that the
word “discriminate” is relevant to the intent inquiry, the only
intent that §1514A requires is the intent to take some adverse
employment action against the whistleblowing employee “because
of ” his protected whistleblowing activity. The statute is
clear that whether an employer “discriminated” in that sense has to
be resolved through the contributing-factor burden-shifting
framework that applies to Sarbanes-Oxley whistleblower claims.

															B

															Statutory context confirms that the word
“discriminate” does not import a “retaliatory intent” requirement:
Requiring a whistleblower to prove his employer’s retaliatory
animus would ignore the statute’s mandatory burden-shifting
framework. The burden-shifting framework was conspicuously absent
from the Second Circuit’s opinion, and UBS now insists that the
statute’s burden shifting addresses only “causation, not intent.”
Brief for Respondents 11. Not so. Burden-shifting frameworks have
long provided a mechanism for getting at intent in employment
discrimination cases, and the contributing-factor burden-shifting
framework is meant to be more lenient than most.

															Consider the burden-shifting framework this
Court has devised for certain Title VII claims. In Watson v.
Fort Worth Bank & Trust, 487 U.S.
977 (1988), the Court explained that “[i]n order to facilitate
the orderly consideration of relevant evidence,” courts rely upon
“a series of shifting evidentiary burdens that are ‘intended
progressively to sharpen the inquiry into the elusive factual
question of intentional discrimination.’ ” Id., at 986
(quoting Texas Dept. of Community Affairs v. Burdine,
450 U.S.
248, 255, n. 8 (1981)). This idea applies with equal force
to the statutory framework here: Because discriminatory intent is
difficult to prove, and because employers “contro[l] most of the
cards,” 135 Cong. Rec., at 5033, burden shifting plays the
necessary role of “forcing the defendant to come forward with some
response” to the employee’s circumstantial evidence, St. Mary’s
Honor Center v. Hicks, 509 U.S.
502, 510–511 (1993). The result is that the trier of fact has
the full picture before it and can make the ultimate determination
as to whether the employer intentionally treated the employee
differently, and worse, because of the employee’s protected trait
or activity.

															The burden-shifting framework provides a means
of getting at intent, and Congress here has decided that the
plaintiff ’s burden on intent is simply to show that the
protected activity was a “contributing factor in the unfavorable
personnel action.” 49 U. S. C. §42121(b)(2)(B)(i); see 18
U. S. C. §1514A(b)(2)(C) (explaining that an action
brought in federal court “shall be governed by the legal burdens of
proof set forth in section 42121(b)”). Once the employee makes that
showing, the burden shifts to the employer to “demonstrat[e], by
clear and convincing evidence, that the employer would have taken
the same unfavorable personnel action in the absence of that
behavior.” 49 U. S. C. §42121(b)(2)(B)(ii). While many
statutes dealing with employment discrimination apply a higher bar,
requiring the plaintiff to show that his protected activity was a
motivating or substantial factor in the adverse action, see,
e.g., EEOC v. Abercrombie & Fitch
Stores, Inc., 575 U.S.
768, 772–773 (2015) (discussing burden in Title VII context),
the incorporation of the contributing-factor standard in
Sarbanes-Oxley reflects a judgment that “ ‘personnel actions
against employees should quite simply not be based on protected
[whistleblowing] activities’ ”—not even a little bit.
Marano v. Department of Justice, 
2 F.3d 1137, 1141 (CA Fed. 1993) (quoting S. Rep. No.
100–413, p. 16 (1988) (discussing WPA); brackets omitted).

															While the Second Circuit attempted to make
“retaliatory intent” a requirement for satisfaction of the
“contributing factor” element, 43 F. 4th, at 259–260, UBS does
not ask this Court to follow suit, and for good reason. The
ordinary meanings of the words “contribute” and “factor” suggest
that the phrase “contributing factor” is broad indeed. See
Webster’s New World College Dictionary 317 (4th ed. 1999) (defining
“contribute,” in the relevant sense, to mean “to have a share in
bringing about (a result); be partly responsible for”); id.,
at 508 (defining “factor” as “any of the circumstances, conditions,
etc. that bring about a result”). Showing that an employer acted
with retaliatory animus is one way of proving that the protected
activity was a contributing factor in the adverse employment
action, but it is not the only way.

															Here, the burden-shifting framework worked as it
should to “ ‘sharpen the inquiry into the elusive factual
question of intentional discrimination.’ ” Watson, 487
U. S., at 986 (quoting Burdine, 450 U. S., at 255,
n. 8). The jury heard both sides of the story. It then
determined that Murray had shown that his protected activity was a
contributing factor in his firing while UBS had not shown that it
would have taken the same action in the absence of his protected
activity. That burden shifting—and not some separate, heavier
burden on the plaintiff to show “retaliatory intent”—is what the
statute requires.[2]

															C

															UBS and its amici argue that, without a
retaliatory intent requirement, innocent employers will face
liability for legitimate, nonretaliatory personnel decisions. See
Brief for Respondents 33–34; Brief for Chamber of Commerce of the
United States of America as Amicus Curiae 22–24. UBS posits
a hypothetical where an employee’s whistleblowing causes a client
to end their relationship with the company, leaving the
whistleblower without any work and ultimately leading to the
elimination of the whistleblower’s position. UBS asserts that
“[u]nder petitioner’s view, the employer would be liable for
retaliation, despite the absence of any intent to retaliate.” Brief
for Respondents 34. The statute, properly understood, does not lead
to that result.

															The statute’s burden-shifting framework provides
that an employer will not be held liable where it “demonstrates, by
clear and convincing evidence, that [it] would have taken the same
unfavorable personnel action in the absence of ” the protected
behavior. 49 U. S. C. §42121(b)(2)(B)(ii). The right way
to think about that kind of same-action causation analysis is to
“change one thing at a time and see if the outcome changes.”
Bostock, 590 U. S., at 656. The question is whether the
employer would have “retain[ed] an otherwise identical employee”
who had not engaged in the protected activity. Id., at 660.
As the Federal Circuit has explained in the WPA context, the
same-action analysis “does not require . . . that the
adverse personnel action be based on facts ‘completely separate and
distinct from protected whistleblowing disclosures.’ ”
Watson v. Department of Justice, 
64 F.3d 1524, 1528 (1995). In that case, the correct inquiry
was whether the employer would have taken the same action if it had
learned of the contents of the employee’s protected disclosure
through other means. Ibid. In UBS’s hypothetical, the
relevant inquiry would be whether the employer still would have
fired the employee if the client had left for some other reason. If
so, it will have no trouble prevailing under the statute.

															To be sure, the contributing-factor framework
that Congress chose here is not as protective of employers as a
motivating-factor framework. That is by design. Congress has
employed the contributing-factor framework in contexts where the
health, safety, or well-being of the public may well depend on
whistleblowers feeling empowered to come forward. This Court cannot
override that policy choice by giving employers more protection
than the statute itself provides.

															*  *  *

															A whistleblower who invokes 18
U. S. C. §1514A bears the burden to prove that his
protected activity “was a contributing factor in the unfavorable
personnel action alleged in the complaint,” 49 U. S. C.
§42121(b)(2)(B)(i), but he is not required to make some further
showing that his employer acted with “retaliatory intent.” The
judgment of the U. S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit
is reversed for the reasons explained above, and the case is
remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

															

															It is so ordered.

 UBS also asks this Court
to affirm on an alternative basis. UBS claims that the Second
Circuit held that the initial jury instruction on the
contributing-factor element, which allowed the jury to find that
Murray’s protected activity was a contributing factor if it
“ ‘tended to affect in any way UBS’s decision to terminate
[his] employment,’ ” independently required the court to set
aside the jury’s verdict. Brief for Respondents 47. UBS is wrong to
characterize the Second Circuit’s footnoted discussion of this
instruction as an alternative holding. See 43 F. 4th 254, 259,
n. 4 (2022). On remand, the Second Circuit remains free to
consider UBS’s separate argument regarding this initial
instruction, but this Court did not grant certiorari to address
that issue.
