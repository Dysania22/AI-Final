															SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

															_________________

															No. 22–1074

															GEORGE SHEETZ, PETITIONER v. COUNTY OF
EL DORADO, CALIFORNIA

															on writ of certiorari to the court of appeal
of california, third appellate district

															[April 12, 2024]

															

															Justice Kavanaugh, with whom Justice Kagan and
Justice Jackson join, concurring.

															I join the Court’s opinion. I write separately
to underscore that the Court has not previously decided—and today
explicitly declines to decide—whether “a permit condition imposed
on a class of properties must be tailored with the same degree of
specificity as a permit condition that targets a particular
development.” Ante, at 10–11. Importantly, therefore,
today’s decision does not address or prohibit the common government
practice of imposing permit conditions, such as impact fees, on new
developments through reasonable formulas or schedules that assess
the impact of classes of development rather than the impact of
specific parcels of property. Moreover, as is apparent from the
fact that today’s decision expressly leaves the question open, no
prior decision of this Court has addressed or prohibited that
longstanding government practice. Both Nollan and
Dolan considered permit conditions tailored to specific
parcels of property. See Dolan v. City of Tigard,
512 U.S.
374, 379–381, 393 (1994); Nollan v. California
Coastal Comm’n, 483 U.S.
825, 828–829 (1987). Those decisions had no occasion to address
permit conditions, such as impact fees, that are imposed on permit
applicants based on reasonable formulas or schedules that assess
the impact of classes of development.
