															SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

															_________________

															No. 22–704

															KATHERINE K. VIDAL, UNDER SECRETARY OF
COMMERCE FOR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND DIRECTOR, UNITED STATES
PATENT AND TRADEMARK OFFICE, PETITIONER v. STEVE ELSTER

															on writ of certiorari to the united states
court of appeals for the federal circuit

															[June 13, 2024]

															

															Justice Kavanaugh, with whom The Chief Justice
joins, concurring in part.

															I join all but Part III of the Court’s opinion.
I agree with the Court that the names clause is constitutional,
particularly in light of the long history of restricting the use of
another’s name in a trademark. In my view, a viewpoint-neutral,
content-based trademark restriction might well be constitutional
even absent such a historical pedigree. We can address that
distinct question as appropriate in a future case. Cf.,
e.g., post, at 7–9 (Barrett, J.,
concurring in part).
