															RYAN THORNELL, DIRECTOR, ARIZONA DEPARTMENT OF
CORRECTIONS, PETITIONER v. DANNY LEE JONES

															on writ of certiorari to the united states
court of appeals for the ninth circuit

															[May 30, 2024]

															

															Justice Jackson, dissenting.

															In its search for legal error in this capital
habeas case, the Court makes many mistakes of its own, including
misreading the Ninth Circuit’s opinion.[1]* I write separately to emphasize a particular misstep:
the Court’s conclusion that “the Ninth Circuit all but ignored the
strong aggravating circumstances in this case.” Ante, at 1.
In my view, the Ninth Circuit’s analysis satisfied its obligations
under Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S.
668 (1984).

															Per our longstanding test for evaluating an
ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim in a capital case, a court
“must consider the totality of the evidence” and ask “whether there
is a reasonable probability that, absent the [trial counsel’s]
errors, the sentencer . . . would have concluded that the
balance of aggravating and mitigating circumstances did not warrant
death.” Id., at 695. That is precisely what the Ninth
Circuit did here. The panel not only evaluated the mitigating
evidence that Jones’s trial counsel failed to unearth, it also
specifically considered all of the aggravating factors. See
Jones v. Ryan, 52 F. 4th 1104, 1131 (CA9 2022).
To assess prejudice, it then reasoned extensively—by
analogy—considering precedent where both the Circuit and this Court
had granted habeas relief even in the presence of similar
aggravators. See id., at 1131–1133.

															To be sure, the Ninth Circuit’s discussion of
the aggravating factors was concise. But there is no benchmark
length for any such discussion. Indeed, this Court has granted
habeas relief after similarly succinct evaluations of aggravating
factors. See, e.g., Porter v. McCollum,
558 U.S.
30, 41–42 (2009) (per curiam) (discussing aggravators in
one paragraph); Rompilla v. Beard, 545 U.S.
374, 390–393 (2005) (no discussion of aggravators);
Wiggins v. Smith, 539 U.S.
510, 534–538 (2003) (same). We can hardly fault the Ninth
Circuit for using the same approach that this Court itself has
previously used.

															Thus, to me, the Court’s claim that the Ninth
Circuit “all but ignored” the aggravators, ante, at 1, rings
hollow. And the majority’s real critique does not appear to relate
to the Ninth Circuit’s methodology. Rather, it merely takes issue
with the weight that the Ninth Circuit assigned to each of the
relevant facts. I agree with Justice Sotomayor that we are not the
right tribunal to parse the extensive factual record in this case
in the first instance. That is doubly true where the Ninth Circuit
committed no legal error in reviewing that record to begin with. I
respectfully dissent.

Notes

*Compare, e.g.,
ante, at 7–8 (accusing the panel of “appl[ying] astrange
Circuit rule that prohibits a court in a Strickland case
from assessing the relative strength of expert witness testimony”),
with Jones v. Ryan, 52 F. 4th 1104, 1129 (CA9
2022) (“This is not to say, of course, that a district court is
prohibited from making credibility determinations”).
