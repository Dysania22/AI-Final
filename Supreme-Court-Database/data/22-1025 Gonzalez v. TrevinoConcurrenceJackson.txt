															SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

															_________________

															No. 22–1025

															_________________

															SYLVIA GONZALEZ, PETITIONER v. EDWARD
TREVINO, II, et al.

															on writ of certiorari to the united states
court of appeals for the fifth circuit

															[June 20, 2024]

															

															Justice Jackson, with whom Justice Sotomayor
joins, concurring.

															Today, the Court rightly recognizes that
petitioner Sylvia Gonzalez’s survey—showing that, in the last
decade, no one charged with the crime for which she was arrested
had engaged in conduct similar to hers—is objective evidence
admissible to prove that she “was arrested when otherwise similarly
situated individuals not engaged in the same sort of protected
speech had not been.” Nieves v. Bartlett, 587 U.S.
391, 407 (2019); see ante, at 5.

															That recognition, however, should not be taken
to suggest that plaintiffs cannot use other types of
objective evidence to make this showing. The Nieves
exception is satisfied in “circumstances where officers have
probable cause to make arrests, but typically exercise their
discretion not to do so.” 587 U. S., at 406. “The only express
limit we placed on the sort of evidence a plaintiff may present for
that purpose is that it must be objective.” Ante, at 4. As
the United States explains, such objective evidence could “include
officers’ employment of an unusual, irregular, or unnecessarily
onerous arrest procedure,” as well as “[t]he timing of and events
leading up to a plaintiff ’s arrest.” Brief for United States
as Amicus Curiae 20.[1]*
Similarly, “if officers falsely document the arrest or include
other indicia of retaliatory motive in arrest-related documents,
that too might suggest meaningfully differential treatment.”
Id., at 21.

															Here, in addition to her survey, Gonzalez
presented this other kind of evidence as well. Before the District
Court, Gonzalez pointed to, among other things, details about the
anomalous procedures used for her arrest and statements in the
arresting officer’s warrant affidavit suggesting a retaliatory
motive. See Brief for Petitioner 43–44. Those categories of
evidence, too, can support the conclusion that Gonzalez “was
arrested when otherwise similarly situated individuals not engaged
in the same sort of protected speech had not been.” Nieves,
587 U. S., at 407. On remand, the lower courts may consider
the full scope of objective evidence that Gonzalez has offered to
establish differential treatment. See ante, at 4.

															With this understanding, I join the Court’s
per curiam opinion.

Notes
1
*Justice Alito suggests that
evidence of this sort—such as the fact that “a police officer has
been surveilling [a plaintiff ’s] house for several
weeks”—would not “count towards the Nieves exception.”
Ante, at 10 (concurring opinion). He does not explain,
however, why such evidence would not be objective, or why such
evidence would not be relevant to proving that a plaintiff “was
arrested when otherwise similarly situated individuals not engaged
in the same sort of protected speech had not been.” Nieves,
587 U. S., at 407.
