															SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

															_________________

															No. 23–50

															_________________

															Jascha Chiaverini, et al., PETITIONERS
v. CITY OF NAPOLEON, OHIO, et al.

															on writ of certiorari to the united states
court of appeals for the sixth circuit

															[June 20, 2024]

															

															Justice Gorsuch, dissenting.

															Section 1983 performs vital work by permitting
individuals to vindicate their constitutional rights in federal
court. But it does not authorize this Court to expound new rights
of its own creation. As this Court has put it, §1983 does not turn
the Constitution into a “ ‘ “font of tort
law.” ’ ” Albright v. Oliver, 510 U.S.
266, 284 (1994) (Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment)
(quoting Parratt v. Taylor, 451
U.S. 527, 544 (1981)).

															Despite that settled rule, the Court today
doubles down on a new tort of its own recent invention—what it
calls a “ Fourth Amendment malicious-prosecution” cause of action.
Ante, at 1; see Thompson v. Clark, 596 U.S.
36, 43–44 (2022). Respectfully, it is hard to know where this tort
comes from. Stare for as long as you like at the Fourth Amendment
and you won’t see anything about prosecutions, malicious or
otherwise. Instead, the Amendment provides that “[t]he right of the
people to be secure . . . against unreasonable searches
and seizures, shall not be violated.”

															As its language suggests, the Fourth Amendment
supplies nothing like a common-law claim for malicious prosecution.
Ante, at 2 (Thomas, J., dissenting); see Cordova
v. Albuquerque, 816 F.3d 645, 662–663 (CA10 2016)
(Gorsuch, J., concurring in judgment). Just consider some of
the differences. This Court has long held that the touchstone of
the Fourth Amendment is objective reasonableness. But a common-law
malicious-prosecution claim focuses on the defendant’s subjective
intent. Ante, at 2 (opinion of Thomas, J.). The Fourth
Amendment addresses the permissibility of a seizure. But a
common-law malicious-prosecution claim can (and usually does)
proceed without one. Ante, at 2–3. A seizure in violation of
the Fourth Amendment can (and often does) take place without the
initiation of any judicial process. But the whole point of a
malicious-prosecution claim is to contest the appropriateness of
past judicial proceedings. Ante, at 2. For all these
reasons, it’s “pretty hard to see how you might squeeze anything
that looks quite like the common law tort of malicious prosecution
into the Fourth Amendment.” Cordova, 816 F. 3d, at 663
(opinion of Gorsuch, J.).

															That is not to say no constitutional hook exists
for a §1983 claim addressing the malicious use of process. Rather,
it seems to me only that such a claim would be more properly housed
in the Fourteenth Amendment. See Albright, 510 U. S.,
at 283 (opinion of Kennedy, J.). After all, unlike the Fourth
Amendment, that provision does focus on judicial proceedings,
guaranteeing those who come before our courts “due process” of law.
See ibid.; Thompson, 596 U. S., at 43,
n. 2; Cordova, 816 F. 3d, at 662 (opinion of
Gorsuch, J.). Inhering in due process is a promise that courts
will respect, at the least, those “customary procedures to which
freemen were entitled by the old law of England.” Sessions
v. Dimaya, 584 U.S. 148, 176 (2018) (Gorsuch, J., concurring
in part and concurring in judgment) (internal quotation marks
omitted). And the common law has long recognized a tort of
malicious prosecution to protect against the abuse of judicial
proceedings. Albright, 510 U. S., at 283 (opinion of
Kennedy, J.).

															Admittedly, a procedural due process claim for
malicious prosecution may come with its own set of limitations.
After all, when a State provides exactly the tort claim the
plaintiff seeks, it provides him with all the process he is due.
See id., at 284; Cordova, 816 F. 3d, at 662
(opinion of Gorsuch, J.). And, consistent with the common law,
many States recognize claims for malicious prosecution. Indeed, the
relevant State here (Ohio) permits such a cause of action. Notably,
too, unlike the tort this Court seeks to cobble together under the
aegis of the Fourth Amendment, Ohio’s tort does not require a
plaintiff to prove that he was seized. Compare Trussell v.
General Motors Corp., 53 Ohio St. 3d 142, 145–146, 559
N.E.2d 732, 735–736 (1990), with ante, at 1 (majority
opinion). Of course, should a State fail to provide a
malicious-prosecution claim to secure his procedural due process
rights, or a fair forum for entertaining such a claim, a federal
court may need to act to vindicate §1983 and the promise of
procedural due process. Cordova, 816 F. 3d, at 665
(opinion of Gorsuch, J.). But in many cases (this one
included), a State malicious-prosecution claim may be both easier
for a plaintiff to prove than anything the Court today provides and
sufficient to ensure any process he is due. Albright, 510
U. S., at 285–286 (opinion of Kennedy, J.);
Cordova, 816 F. 3d, at 662 (opinion of
Gorsuch, J.).

															For these reasons, I respectfully dissent.
