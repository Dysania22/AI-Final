															PAUL ERLINGER, PETITIONER v. UNITED
STATES

															on writ of certiorari to the united states
court of appeals for the seventh circuit

															[June 21, 2024]

															

															Justice Gorsuch delivered the opinion of the
Court.

															This case concerns the Armed Career Criminal Act
(ACCA) and the Fifth and Sixth Amendments. ACCA imposes lengthy
mandatory prison terms on certain defendants who have previously
committed three violent felonies or serious drug offenses on
separate occasions. The question we face is whether a judge may
decide that a defendant’s past offenses were committed on separate
occasions under a preponderance-of-the-evidence standard, or
whether the Fifth and Sixth Amendments require a unanimous jury to
make that determination beyond a reasonable doubt.

															I

															In 2017, the federal government charged Paul
Erlinger under 18 U. S. C. §922(g) with being a felon
unlawfully in possession of a firearm. At the time, a conviction
for that offense ordinarily carried a sentence of up to 10 years in
prison. §924(a)(2) (2012 ed.). But the government also charged Mr.
Erlinger under ACCA. And under that statute, a defendant found
guilty of violating §922(g) can face even more severe punishment.
Specifically, if the defendant has three prior convictions for
“violent felon[ies]” or “serious drug offense[s]” that were
“committed on occasions different from one another,” ACCA increases
the prison term he faces to a minimum of 15 years and a maximum of
life. §924(e)(1) (2012 ed.).

															Mr. Erlinger pleaded guilty to violating
§922(g). But in doing so, he stressed that his previous convictions
were more than a decade old and since then he had turned his life
around, secured a steady job, built a family, and remained free
from drugs. Tr. of Plea and Sentencing Hearing in No. 2:18–cr–00013
(SD Ind., Oct. 24, 2018), ECF Doc. 67, p. 24. In light of
these facts, the sentencing judge stated that a 5-year prison term
would represent a “fair sentence.” Id., at 30. But the judge
also found it more likely than not that Mr. Erlinger’s past
included three ACCA-qualifying offenses committed on three
different occasions. Id., at 17. And based on that finding,
the court concluded, it had no authority to issue a 5-year
sentence. Id., at 29–30. Instead, ACCA required a sentence
of at least 15 years. That was “too high” for Mr. Erlinger’s crime,
the court emphasized, but it had “no power” to order anything less.
Ibid.

															Shortly after the court issued a 15-year
sentence consistent with ACCA, the ground shifted. The Seventh
Circuit issued decisions indicating that two of the three offenses
on which the district court had relied to invoke ACCA did not
qualify as “violent felon[ies]” or “serious drug offense[s].” 77
F. 4th 617, 619 (2023) (citing United States v.
Glispie, 978 F.3d 502 (2020), and United States v.
De La Torre, 940 F.3d 938 (2019)). That left Mr. Erlinger
with only one qualifying prior conviction, not the three ACCA
requires. Recognizing as much, the district court vacated its
sentence and set the case for a new sentencing hearing. Order, ECF
Doc. 81.

															There, prosecutors once more pursued a 15-year
ACCA sentence. This time, though, they pointed to a new set of
prior convictions arising from burglaries Mr. Erlinger committed
when he was 18 years old—some 26 years before his §922(g) charge.
Tr. of Video Resentencing Hearing, ECF Doc. 120, at 37–38. As the
government told it, within a span of days Mr. Erlinger burglarized
a pizza shop, a sporting goods store, and two restaurants.
Ibid. Because each of these burglaries occurred on different
occasions, the government submitted, each could serve as an ACCA
predicate and collectively they could support an ACCA sentence.
Id., at 39–40.

															Mr. Erlinger protested. He maintained that his
decades-old burglaries had not occurred on four separate occasions
but during a single criminal episode, all of which meant he still
lacked the three prior offenses ACCA requires. Id., at 20.
More than that, Mr. Erlinger argued, the question whether he
committed his prior burglaries during a single episode or on
distinct occasions required an assessment of the facts surrounding
those offenses. Id., at 22–23. And, he contended, the Fifth
and Sixth Amendments entitled him to have a jury make that
assessment. Id., at 23.

															The district court rejected Mr. Erlinger’s
request for a jury. It proceeded to find for itself that each of
his 26-year-old burglaries occurred on distinct occasions.
Id., at 48–49. Armed with this finding, the court held that
Mr. Erlinger had at least three previous ACCA-qualifying offenses
and once more issued a 15-year sentence. Again, the court said that
it thought the result “unfortunate” and “excessive.” Id., at
50. But, again, it said ACCA left it no choice. Id., at
50–51.

															On appeal, Mr. Erlinger renewed his argument
that the Fifth and Sixth Amendments entitled him to have a jury
decide whether his burglaries occurred on different occasions. But
this time, the government confessed error. The Constitution, it
said, “requires a jury” to decide unanimously and beyond a
reasonable doubt whether Mr. Erlinger’s ACCA predicates were
“ ‘committed on occasions different from one
another.’ ”

															In explaining its turnabout, the government
pointed to this Court’s recent decision in Wooden v.
United States, 595 U.S. 360 (2022). That decision did not
directly address whether a judge may, or a jury must, resolve
disputes about whether multiple crimes occurred on multiple
occasions. Id., at 365, n. 3; see id., at 397,
n. 7 (Gorsuch, J., concurring in judgment). But, the
government acknowledged, Wooden did hold that ACCA’s
occasions “inquiry” can require an examination of a “range” of
facts, including whether the defendant’s past offenses were
“committed close in time,” whether they were committed near to or
far from one another, and whether the offenses were “similar or
intertwined” in purpose and character. Id., at 369. And
given the intensely factual nature of this inquiry and the impact
its resolution can have on a defendant’s sentence, the government
admitted, a jury must resolve it. That conclusion, the government
represented, flows directly from this Court’s consistent holdings
that the Fifth and Sixth Amendments generally guarantee a defendant
the right to have a unanimous jury find beyond a reasonable doubt
any fact that increases his exposure to punishment. Brief for
United States in No. 22–1926 (CA7), pp. 9–11.

															Despite the government’s concession, the Seventh
Circuit refused to disturb the district court’s sentence. 77
F. 4th, at 621–622. That left Mr. Erlinger to petition this
Court for certiorari. The government filed a brief in support of
his petition. In it, the government argued that a number of courts
of appeals have refused requests for juries in cases like Mr.
Erlinger’s and that “this Court’s intervention is necessary to
ensure that the circuits correctly recognize defendants’
constitutional rights in this context.” Brief for United States on
Pet. for Cert. 5–6.

															We agreed to take up Mr. Erlinger’s case to
decide whether ACCA’s occasions inquiry must be resolved by a jury.
601 U. S. ___ (2023). Because the government now agrees with
Mr. Erlinger about the proper resolution of that question, we
appointed Nick Harper to defend the judgment below as amicus
curiae. 601 U. S. ___ (2023). He has ably discharged his
responsibilities.

															A

															Prominent among the reasons colonists cited in
the Declaration of Independence for their break with Great Britain
was the fact Parliament and the Crown had “depriv[ed] [them] in
many cases, of the benefits of Trial by Jury.” ¶20. For centuries,
English law had recognized the right to trial by jury.
Duncan v. Louisiana, 391 U.S.
145, 151 (1968). Yet, as tensions grew between the British
Empire and its American Colonies, imperial authorities responded by
stripping away that ancient right. By their lights, colonial juries
“ ‘were not to be trusted’ ” because they found for
defendants too often. D. Lovejoy, Rights Imply Equality: The Case
Against Admiralty Jurisdiction in America, 1764–1776, 16 Wm. &
Mary Q. 459, 468 (1959). To secure more vigorous enforcement of the
Stamp Act and other unpopular laws, authorities directed more and
more cases to vice-admiralty courts where crown-appointed judges,
rather than local juries, decided the defendant’s fate.
Jones v. United States, 526 U.S.
227, 245–246 (1999). Just as authorities hoped, the tactic
proved “ ‘most effective’ ” at securing the verdicts they
wished. Parklane Hosiery Co. v. Shore, 439 U.S.
322, 340, n. 3 (1979) (Rehnquist, J., dissenting) (quoting
11 W. Holdsworth, A History of English Law 110 (1966)).

															After securing their independence, the founding
generation sought to ensure what happened before would not happen
again. As John Adams put it, the founders saw representative
government and trial by jury as “the heart and lungs” of liberty.
Letter from Clarendon to W. Pym (Jan. 27, 1766), in 1 Papers of
John Adams 169 (R. Taylor ed. 1977). “[W]ithout them,” he wrote, we
“have no other fortification . . . against being ridden like
horses, fleeced like sheep, worked like cattle, and fed and clothed
like swine and hounds.” Ibid. Reflecting that sentiment, the
right to trial by jury in criminal cases was, on one telling, the
only right included in every newly enacted state constitution. A.
Alschuler & A. Deiss, A Brief History of the Criminal Jury in
the United States, 61 U. Chi. L. Rev. 867, 870 (1994).

															Those who drafted our Federal Constitution took
just as strong a stand on the jury trial right. As originally
proposed, the Constitution promised that “[t]he Trial of all
Crimes, except in Cases of Impeachment, shall be by Jury.”
Art. III, §2, cl. 3. In the ratification debates that
followed, some questioned the adequacy of this provision; even with
it, they feared, the new federal government might fall prey to the
kinds of temptations that led the British to restrict the jury
trial right in the colonies. That right, they argued, had to be
“guard[ed] with the most jealous circumspection.” A [New Hampshire]
Farmer, No. 3, June 6, 1788, quoted in The Complete Bill of Rights
681 (N. Cogan 2d ed. 2015) (internal quotation marks and italics
omitted). To address this and other concerns about the new
Constitution, James Madison agreed to draft a series of amendments
we now know as the Bill of Rights. No fewer than three of those ten
amendments touch on the right to trial by jury, two with
implications for criminal cases. Amdts. 5, 6, 7. Madison himself
described protections for the jury trial right as among “the most
valuable” that appear in “the whole list” of amendments he
produced. 1 Annals of Cong. 755 (1789).

															The Sixth Amendment promises that “[i]n all
criminal prosecutions the accused” has “the right to a speedy and
public trial, by an impartial jury.” Inhering in that guarantee is
an assurance that a guilty verdict will issue only from a unanimous
jury. Ramos v. Louisiana, 590 U.S. 83, 93 (2020). The
Fifth Amendment further promises that the government may not
deprive individuals of their liberty without “due process of law.”
It is a promise that safeguards for criminal defendants those
procedural protections well established at common law, including
the “ancient rule” that the government must prove to a jury every
one of its charges beyond a reasonable doubt. United States
v. Haymond, 588 U.S. 634, 641 (2019) (plurality opinion);
see Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530
U.S. 466, 477–478 (2000); United States v.
Gaudin, 515 U.S.
506, 510 (1995); Sullivan v. Louisiana, 508 U.S.
275, 277–278 (1993).

															The Fifth and Sixth Amendments placed the jury
at the heart of our criminal justice system. From the start, those
provisions were understood to require the government to include in
its criminal charges “ ‘all the facts and circumstances which
constitute the offence.’ ” Apprendi, 530 U. S., at
478 (quoting J. Archbold, Pleading and Evidence in Criminal Cases
44 (15th ed. 1862)). Should an “indictment or ‘accusation
. . . lack any particular fact which the laws ma[d]e
essential to the punishment,’ it was treated as ‘no accusation’ at
all.” Haymond, 588 U. S., at 642 (quoting 1 J. Bishop,
Criminal Procedure §87, p. 55 (2d ed. 1872) (some alterations
omitted)). And at all times the “ ‘truth of every
accusation’ ” against a defendant had to be “ ‘confirmed
by the unanimous suffrage of twelve of [his] equals and
neighbours.’ ” Apprendi, 530 U. S., at 477
(quoting 4 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England 343
(1769); emphasis deleted).

															Equally, the Fifth and Sixth Amendments sought
to ensure that a judge’s power to punish would “deriv[e] wholly”
from, and remain always “control[led]” by, the jury and its
verdict. Blakely v. Washington, 542 U.S.
296, 306 (2004). Ordinarily, common-law crimes carried
“specific sanctions, and ‘[o]nce the facts of the offense were
determined by the jury, the judge was meant simply to impose the
prescribed sentence.’ ” Haymond, 588 U. S., at 642
(quoting Alleyne v. United States, 570 U.S.
99, 108 (2013) (plurality opinion)). Even when it came to early
American statutes that gave judges a measure of discretion in
selecting among possible sentences, “the ranges themselves were
linked to particular facts” found by the jury. Alleyne, 570
U. S., at 109 (collecting examples). All of which guaranteed
that a judge could not “ ‘swell the penalty above what the law
. . . provided for the acts’ ” found by a jury of
the defendant’s peers. Haymond, 588 U. S., at 642
(quoting Apprendi, 530 U. S., at 519 (Thomas, J.,
concurring)).

															These principles represent not “procedural
formalit[ies]” but “fundamental reservation[s] of power” to the
American people. Blakely, 542 U. S., at 305–306. By
requiring the Executive Branch to prove its charges to a unanimous
jury beyond a reasonable doubt, the Fifth and Sixth Amendments seek
to mitigate the risk of prosecutorial overreach and misconduct,
including the pursuit of “pretended offenses” and “arbitrary
convictions.” The Federalist No. 83, p. 499 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961);
accord, Federal Farmer, Letter XV (Jan. 18, 1788), reprinted in 2
The Complete Anti-Federalist 320 (H. Storing ed. 1981). By
requiring a unanimous jury to find every fact essential to an
offender’s punishment, those amendments similarly seek to constrain
the Judicial Branch, ensuring that the punishments courts issue are
not the result of a judicial “inquisition” but are premised on laws
adopted by the people’s elected representatives and facts found by
members of the community. Blakely, 542 U. S., at 307;
Haymond, 588 U. S., at 640–641. Both of these checks on
governmental power, the framers appreciated, were “anchor[s]”
essential to prevent a slide back toward regimes like the
vice-admiralty courts they so despised. Letter from T. Jefferson to
T. Paine (July 11, 1789), reprinted in 15 Papers of Thomas
Jefferson 266, 269 (J. Boyd ed. 1958).

															With the passage of time, and accelerating in
earnest in the 20th century, various governments in this country
sought to experiment with new trial and sentencing practices. See
Mistretta v. United States, 488
U.S. 361, 363–367 (1989); Williams v. New York,
337 U.S.
241, 247–248 (1949); see also P. Tappan, Sentencing Under the
Model Penal Code, 23 Law & Contemp. Prob. 528, 529–532 (1958).
But in case after case, this Court has cautioned that, while some
experiments may be tolerable, all must remain within the Fifth and
Sixth Amendments’ guardrails.

															So, for example, in Apprendi this Court
faced a case involving a New Jersey offense that ordinarily carried
a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison. 530 U. S., at 468.
The State, however, had adopted a novel “sentencing enhancement”
that purported to allow a judge to impose an even longer term of
imprisonment after finding, by a preponderance of the evidence,
that the offender’s crime was motivated by racial bias. Id.,
at 468–471. Relying on that statutory authority, the sentencing
judge ordered the defendant to serve 12 years in prison.
Id., at 471. This Court found the sentence unconstitutional,
and did so for a by-now familiar reason: Only a jury may find
“ ‘facts that increase the prescribed range of penalties to
which a criminal defendant is exposed.’ ” Id., at
490.

															It is a principle we have since reiterated in
response to a variety of other recent sentencing innovations. See
Haymond, 588 U. S., at 644 (collecting cases). And it
is a principle, we have observed, that does not just apply when a
judge seeks to issue a sentence that exceeds the maximum
penalty authorized by a jury’s findings (or a guilty plea). It is a
principle that also applies when a judge seeks to increase a
defendant’s minimum punishment. Alleyne illustrates
the point. There, we confronted a case in which a jury had
convicted the defendant of a crime that usually carried a sentence
of between five years and life in prison. 570 U. S., at
103–104. But a separate statutory “sentencing enhancement”
ostensibly allowed the judge to transform that 5-year minimum
sentence into a 7-year minimum sentence if he found a certain
additional fact by a preponderance of the evidence. Ibid.
That innovation, too, the Court held, improperly invaded the jury’s
province because “[a] fact that increases” a defendant’s exposure
to punishment, whether by triggering a higher maximum or
minimum sentence, must “be submitted to a jury” and found
unanimously and beyond a reasonable doubt. Id., at
111–113.

															The principles Apprendi and
Alleyne discussed are so firmly entrenched that we have now
overruled several decisions inconsistent with them. See,
e.g., Hurst v. Florida, 577 U.S.
92, 101–102 (2016) (overruling Hildwin v.
Florida, 490 U.S.
638 (1989) (per curiam), and Spaziano v.
Florida, 468 U.S.
447 (1984)); Alleyne, 570 U. S., at 107 (overruling
Harris v. United States, 536
U.S. 545 (2002)); Ring v. Arizona, 536 U.S.
584, 609 (2002) (overruling Walton v. Arizona,
497 U.S.
639 (1990)).

															B

															Commendably, the government concedes before
us, as it did before the court of appeals, what all this means for
Mr. Erlinger’s case and others like it. Under §922(g), Mr. Erlinger
faced between 0 and 10 years in prison. §924(a)(2) (2012 ed.). To
trigger ACCA and expose him to longer prison terms, the government
had to prove that his past included three convictions for “violent
felon[ies]” or “serious drug offense[s]” that were “committed on
occasions different from one another.” §924(e)(1). And under
Wooden, deciding whether those past offenses occurred on
three or more different occasions is a fact-laden task. Were the
crimes “committed close in time”? 595 U. S., at 369. How about
the “[p]roximity” of their “location[s]”? Ibid. Were the
offenses “similar or intertwined” in purpose and character?
Ibid. All these questions, Wooden observed, “may be
relevant” to determining whether the offenses were committed on one
occasion or separate ones—and all require facts to be found before
ACCA’s more punitive mandatory minimum sentence may be lawfully
deployed. Ibid.

															As the government recognizes, there is no doubt
what the Constitution requires in these circumstances: Virtually
“any fact” that “ ‘increase[s] the prescribed range of
penalties to which a criminal defendant is exposed’ ” must be
resolved by a unanimous jury beyond a reasonable doubt (or freely
admitted in a guilty plea). Apprendi, 530 U. S., at
490; see Brief for United States 9. Judges may not assume the
jury’s factfinding function for themselves, let alone purport to
perform it using a mere preponderance-of-the-evidence standard. To
hold otherwise might not portend a revival of the vice-admiralty
courts the framers so feared. See Part II–A, supra. But all
the same, it would intrude on a power the Fifth and Sixth
Amendments reserve to the American people.

															Really, this case is as nearly on all fours with
Apprendi and Alleyne as any we might imagine. In
Apprendi, a judge relied on his own factual findings under a
preponderance-of-the-evidence standard to increase the defendant’s
maximum sentence from 10 to 20 years. 530 U. S., at 469. In
Alleyne, a judge proceeded the same way to increase the
defendant’s minimum sentence from five to seven years. 570
U. S., at 104. Here, the sentencing court’s factual finding
that Mr. Erlinger’s offenses occurred on at least three separate
occasions had the effect of increasing both the maximum and
minimum sentences he faced. Rather than a maximum sentence of 10
years in prison, the judge’s finding left Mr. Erlinger exposed to
life in prison. Rather than a minimum penalty of no prison time,
the judge’s finding meant Mr. Erlinger had to serve at least 15
years.

															While recognizing Mr. Erlinger was entitled to
have a jury resolve ACCA’s occasions inquiry unanimously and beyond
a reasonable doubt, we decide no more than that. For purposes of
the proceedings before us, the parties take as given that Mr.
Erlinger committed four burglaries and that each qualifies as a
“violent offense” under ACCA. But they disagree vigorously about
whether those burglaries took place on at least three different
occasions (so that ACCA’s enhanced sentences would apply) or during
a single criminal episode (so that they would not). Presented with
evidence about the times, locations, purpose, and character of
those crimes, a jury might have concluded that some or all occurred
on different occasions. Or it might not have done so. All we can
say for certain is that the sentencing court erred in taking that
decision from a jury of Mr. Erlinger’s peers.[1]

															III

															A

															The Court-appointed amicus resists the
conclusion we reach. Unlike Justice Jackson, see n. 1,
supra, however, amicus does not dispute the
Constitution’s time-honored guarantee that a unanimous jury
ordinarily must find beyond a reasonable doubt any fact that
increases a defendant’s exposure to punishment. See Brief for
Court-Appointed Amicus Curiae 1. In defending the decision
below, amicus relies instead on an exception to that rule
this Court announced in Almendarez-Torres v. United
States, 523 U.S.
224 (1998). On amicus’s telling, that exception permits
a judge to find perhaps any fact related to a defendant’s past
offenses, including whether he committed them on different
occasions. Brief for Court-Appointed Amicus Curiae 10. The
principal dissent presses the same line of argument. Post,
at 5 (opinion of Kavanaugh, J.).

															We disagree. In Almendarez-Torres, the
Court considered sentencing laws applicable to aliens who returned
to the United States after a previous removal. The default
sentencing range was up to two years of imprisonment. 8
U. S. C. §1326(a) (1994 ed.). But a finding that the
government previously removed the alien after a “conviction for
commission of an aggravated felony” triggered a new maximum penalty
of up to 20 years in prison. §1326(b) (1994 ed.). In
Almendarez-Torres, the Court permitted a judge to undertake
the job of finding the fact of a prior conviction—and that job
alone. 523 U. S., at 246–247.

															Almost immediately, too, the decision came under
scrutiny. Jones, 526 U. S., at 249, n. 10. The
Court has since described Almendarez-Torres as “at best an
exceptional departure” from “historic practice.” Apprendi,
530 U. S., at 487. That decision, we have said, parted ways
from the “uniform course of decision during the entire history of
our jurisprudence.” Id., at 490. It was “arguabl[y]
. . . incorrec[t].” Id., at 489. And it amounted
to an “unusual . . . exception to the Sixth Amendment
rule in criminal cases that ‘any fact that increases the penalty
for a crime’ must be proved to a jury.” Pereida v.
Wilkinson, 592 U.S. 224, 238 (2021) (quoting
Apprendi, 530 U. S., at 490).

															In separate opinions, a number of Justices have
criticized Almendarez-Torres further yet, and Justice
Thomas, whose vote was essential to the majority in that case, has
called for it to be overruled. See, e.g., Mathis v.
United States, 579 U.S. 500, 522 (2016) (Thomas, J.,
concurring); Descamps v. United States, 570 U.S.
254, 280 (2013) (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment);
Shepard v. United States, 544 U.S.
13, 27 (2005) (Thomas, J., concurring in part and concurring in
judgment); see also Jones, 526 U. S., at 252–253
(Stevens, J., concurring); Monge v. California,
524 U.S.
721, 741 (1998) (Scalia, J., joined by Souter and Ginsburg,
JJ., dissenting).

															Still, no one in this case has asked us to
revisit Almendarez-Torres. Nor is there need to do so today.
In the years since that decision, this Court has expressly
delimited its reach. It persists as a “narrow exception” permitting
judges to find only “the fact of a prior conviction.”
Alleyne, 570 U. S., at 111, n. 1. Under that
exception, a judge may “do no more, consistent with the Sixth
Amendment, than determine what crime, with what elements, the
defendant was convicted of.” Mathis, 579 U. S., at
511–512. We have reiterated this limit on the scope of
Almendarez-Torres “over and over,” to the point of
“downright tedium.” 579 U. S., at 510, 519.[2] And so understood,
Almendarez-Torres does nothing to save the sentence in this
case. To determine whether Mr. Erlinger’s prior convictions
triggered ACCA’s enhanced penalties, the district court had to do
more than identify his previous convictions and the legal elements
required to sustain them. It had to find that those offenses
occurred on at least three separate occasions. And, in doing so,
the court did more than Almendarez-Torres allows.

															B

															Perhaps, amicus replies, but perhaps
not. If Almendarez-Torres permits a judge to find “what
crime, with what elements, the defendant was convicted of,”
Mathis, 579 U. S., at 511–512, amicus reasons,
that necessarily implies a judge may also find the jurisdiction in
which the underlying offense occurred and the date it happened.
Brief for Court-Appointed Amicus Curiae 29. And,
amicus continues, in at least some (but admittedly not all)
cases, knowing those facts will make the occasions inquiry so
“ ‘straightforward’ ” that sending it to a jury would be
pointlessly inefficient. Id., at 39–40.

															Again, we disagree. To conduct the narrow
inquiry Almendarez-Torres authorizes, a court may need to
know the jurisdiction in which the defendant’s crime occurred and
its date in order to ascertain what legal elements the government
had to prove to secure a conviction in that place at that time. And
to answer those questions, a sentencing court may sometimes consult
“a restricted set of materials,” often called Shepard
documents, that include judicial records, plea agreements, and
colloquies between a judge and the defendant. Descamps, 570
U. S., at 262; see Shepard, 544 U. S., at 20–21,
26; Taylor v. United States, 495
U.S. 575, 602 (1990).

															None of that, however, means that a court may
use Shepard documents or any other materials for any other
purpose. To ensure compliance with the Fifth and Sixth Amendments,
a sentencing judge may use the information he gleans from
Shepard documents for the “limited function” of determining
the fact of a prior conviction and the then-existing elements of
that offense. Descamps, 570 U. S., at 260. “[N]o more”
is allowed. Mathis, 579 U. S., at 511. In particular, a
judge may not use information in Shepard documents to decide
“what the defendant . . . actually d[id],” or the “means”
or “manner” in which he committed his offense in order to increase
the punishment to which he might be exposed. 579 U. S.,
at 504, 510–511; see Descamps, 570 U. S., at 269. To
sanction that practice would be to allow a sentencing court to do
exactly what the Fifth and Sixth Amendments forbid.
Ibid.

															The sentencing court in this case disregarded
these constraints. To determine what legal elements attached to Mr.
Erlinger’s decades-old offenses, the court might have needed to
consult Shepard documents to ascertain the jurisdiction in
which they occurred and the date on which they happened. But the
court had no need or authority “to go any further,” Mathis,
579 U. S., at 511, and assume for itself the responsibility of
deciding whether Mr. Erlinger’s past offenses differed enough in
time, location, character, and purpose to have transpired on
different occasions. Let alone undertake that inquiry all with an
eye toward increasing his punishment. The Fifth and Sixth
Amendments “contemplat[e] that a jury—not a sentencing court—will
find such facts, unanimously and beyond a reasonable doubt.”
Descamps, 570 U. S., at 269.[3]

															Other considerations fortify our conclusion.
Often, as amicus concedes, Shepard documents will not
contain all the information needed to conduct a sensible ACCA
occasions inquiry, such as the exact times and locations of the
defendant’s past crimes. Brief for Court-Appointed Amicus
Curiae 40. Even when Shepard documents do contain that
kind of granular information, more still may be required. After
all, this Court has held that no particular lapse of time or
distance between offenses automatically separates a single occasion
from distinct ones. Wooden, 595 U. S., at 369–370.
Often, a qualitative assessment about “the character and
relationship” of the offenses may be required. Id., at 369.
So may an inquiry into whether the crimes shared “a common scheme
or purpose.” Ibid.

															Not only are Shepard documents of limited
utility, they can be “prone to error.” Mathis, 579
U. S., at 512; see also Brief for National Association of
Federal Defenders as Amicus Curiae 8–15 (NAFD Brief )
(recounting examples of material errors); post, at 25
(opinion of Jackson, J.) (acknowledging records are “imperfect” and
may contain “material gaps”). The risk of error may be especially
grave when it comes to facts recounted in Shepard documents
on which adversarial testing was “unnecessary” in the prior
proceeding. Mathis, 579 U. S., at 512. As we have
recognized, “[a]t trial, and still more at plea hearings, a
defendant may have no incentive to contest what does not matter” to
his conviction at the time. Ibid. He may even “ ‘have
good reason not to’ ” haggle over seemingly immaterial errors
in his judicial records. Ibid. (quoting Descamps, 570
U. S., at 270).

															Those realities counsel caution in the use of
Shepard documents. At the time of his prior conviction, a
defendant might not have cared if a judicial record contained a
mistake about, say, the time or location of his offense. Back then,
fine details like those might not have mattered a bit to his guilt
or innocence. Contesting them needlessly, too, might have risked
squandering the patience and good will of a jury or the judge
responsible for pronouncing a sentence. Yet, years later and faced
with an ACCA charge, those kinds of details can carry with them
life-altering consequences. For Mr. Erlinger, they may mean perhaps
10 more years in prison. As a matter of fair notice alone, old
recorded details, prone to error, sometimes untested, often
inessential, and the consequences of which a defendant may not have
appreciated at the time, “should not come back to haunt [him] many
years down the road by triggering a lengthy mandatory sentence.”
579 U. S., at 512; see also Jones, 526 U. S., at
249.

															We do not question amicus’s assessment
that in many cases the occasions inquiry will be
“ ‘straightforward.’ ” Brief for Court-Appointed
Amicus Curiae 39. Often, a defendant’s past offenses will be
different enough and separated by enough time and space that there
is little question he committed them on separate occasions. But
none of that means a judge rather than a jury should make the call.
There is no efficiency exception to the Fifth and Sixth Amendments.
In a free society respectful of the individual, a criminal
defendant enjoys the right to hold the government to the burden of
proving its case beyond a reasonable doubt to a unanimous jury of
his peers “ ‘regardless of how overwhelmin[g]’ ” the
evidence may seem to a judge. Rose v. Clark,
478 U.S.
570, 578 (1986).[4]

															C

															Amicus next asks us to turn from
doctrine to history. While our precedents have consistently read
Almendarez-Torres as permitting a judge to find only the
fact of a prior conviction and the elements required to sustain it,
he insists our precedents are mistaken. Properly understood, he
submits, the Fifth and Sixth Amendments’ original meaning and
“deep” common-law traditions authorize judges at sentencing to find
all manner of facts about an offender’s past crimes. Brief for
Court-Appointed Amicus Curiae 7.

															We have been down this road before. In
Apprendi, the Court carefully studied the original meaning
of the Fifth and Sixth Amendments and found that almost “any fact
that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed
statutory maximum” was understood at the time of the Nation’s
founding to be a fact a jury must find. 530 U. S., at 490; see
also id., at 499–512 (Thomas, J., concurring). In the years
since, we have come to the same conclusion in one decision after
another. See, e.g., Mathis, 579 U. S., at 510;
supra, at 10 (collecting cases).

															To reconsider all those precedents now would
require, at the least, proof “convincing indeed.” Gaudin,
515 U. S., at 515. Yet amicus offers nothing like that.
He points to the “supplemental-information” procedures a few States
employed “in the early 19th century.” Brief for Court-Appointed
Amicus Curiae 15. Those procedures allowed prosecutors
seeking enhanced penalties premised on a defendant’s past
convictions to charge them in “a supplemental, post-conviction
information,” rather than in “a pre-conviction indictment.”
Ibid. And, amicus stresses, this Court upheld one
State’s supplemental-information scheme in Graham v. West
Virginia, 224 U.S.
616 (1912). The principal dissent echoes the same points.
Post, at 14–16 (opinion of Kavanaugh, J.).

															But, if anything, the evidence amicus
cites does more to hurt than help his cause. For one thing, a
sentencing procedure followed by a few States hardly represents
“convincing” proof that our precedents have mistaken the original
meaning of the Fifth and Sixth Amendments. Gaudin, 515
U. S., at 515; see id., at 519. For another, when this
Court upheld one of these supplemental-information schemes in
Graham, it stressed that, under the law’s terms, even “the
fact of former conviction” had to be “charged” by prosecutors and
then “determined by a jury in a proceeding thereby instituted.” 224
U. S., at 630. Put those points together and amicus’s
evidence provides perhaps more reason to question
Almendarez-Torres’s narrow exception than to expand
it.[5]

															Reaching for another tradition, amicus
(but not the principal dissent) turns to the Constitution’s Double
Jeopardy Clause. That Clause, amicus observes, permits a
judge to ask whether the government has charged a defendant for the
same crime a second time. From this, he suggests, it must be that a
judge can also look into the defendant’s past conduct to increase
his sentence. Brief for Court-Appointed Amicus Curiae 25–26.
But that, too, does not follow. The Double Jeopardy Clause protects
a defendant by prohibiting a judge from even empaneling a
jury when the defendant has already faced trial on the charged
crime. See, e.g., Green v. United States,
355 U.S.
184, 188 (1957). The Fifth and Sixth Amendments’ jury trial
rights provide a defendant with entirely complementary protections
at a different stage of the proceedings by ensuring that, once a
jury is lawfully empaneled, the government must prove beyond
a reasonable doubt to a unanimous jury the facts necessary to
sustain the punishment it seeks.

															Finally, amicus (rejoined now by the
principal dissent, see post, at 15–18 (opinion of Kavanaugh,
J.)) directs us to case law and statutes in four other States—South
Carolina, Louisiana, Alabama, and Kansas. After the Constitution’s
adoption, amicus suggests, each of these States left “a wide
range of recidivism-related issues” for judges, rather than juries,
to resolve. Brief for Court-Appointed Amicus Curiae 18.

															But what does this prove? Here again,
amicus points to procedures in less than a handful of
States. That is not the kind of “uniform postratification practice”
that can sometimes “shed light upon the meaning” of the
Constitution. Gaudin, 515 U. S., at 519. Nor, again, do
these practices prove much even taken on their own terms. Some of
these States permitted a judge to make “sequencing”
determinations—deciding, for example, whether the present offense
was the defendant’s “ ‘second or subsequent’ ” offense.
Brief for Court-Appointed Amicus Curiae 14, and n. 1,
18–19.[6] Some allowed a judge
to find whether the defendant had successfully overturned a prior
conviction on appeal or secured a pardon. Id., at 19–20, and
n. 4.[7] Some authorized a
judge to find whether a defendant’s current offense and past crime
occurred within a specified period of time. Id., at
19.[8] All told,
amicus’s evidence may suggest that in a small number of
jurisdictions judges could find the existence, number, and dates of
a defendant’s prior convictions. But none of this provides a
persuasive basis for revisiting our many precedents prohibiting
judges from doing more. Let alone prove “ ‘a longstanding
tradition’ ” in this Nation allowing a judge to find any fact
regarding a defendant’s “recidivis[m].” Post, at 5 (opinion
of Kavanaugh, J.).

															For that matter, it is not clear whether these
four States always allowed judges to find even the fact of a
defendant’s prior conviction. Take South Carolina. In State
v. Smith, 8 Rich. 460 (SC 1832), the court seemed to hold
that the government did not have to allege in its indictment that
the defendant had been previously convicted “for the crime of horse
stealing” because that was a question for “the Court,” id.,
at 460–461. But, as another State’s supreme court recognized, in so
holding Smith may have gone “too far.” State v.
Burgett, 22 Ark. 323, 324 (1860). It is unclear, too,
whether Smith even accurately reflected South Carolina’s
customary practice. Apprendi, 530 U. S., at 509,
n. 5 (Thomas, J., concurring). Similar problems attend
amicus’s reliance on historic Louisiana practices. In
State v. Hudson, 32 La. Ann. 1052 (1880), the
Louisiana Supreme Court held that a jury did not “ha[ve] to pass”
upon the existence of “previous convictions.” Id., at 1053.
But Louisiana “overruled” Hudson three decades later,
calling it out of step with “the common law” and “other
jurisdictions.” State v. Compagno, 125 La. 669,
671–672, 51 So. 681, 682 (1910). Later still, amicus
contends, Louisiana revived Hudson in State v.
Guidry, 169 La. 215, 222, 124 So. 832, 835 (1929). See Brief
for Court-Appointed Amicus Curiae 14. But however that may
be, the historical practices in the four States amicus
highlights do not appear to have been nearly as uniform or
expansive as he supposes.

															D

															Finally, amicus asks us to consider
some practical problems. Most especially, he argues that leaving
the occasions inquiry to juries would do more to prejudice than
protect defendants. Id., at 41–47. It would because
requiring prosecutors to prove that the defendant’s prior crimes
took place on distinct occasions would enable them “to regale
juries with the details” of the defendant’s past misconduct.
Id., at 42; see also post, at 18–21 (opinion of
Kavanaugh, J.); post, at 19–23 (opinion of Jackson, J.).

															But just as arguments from efficiency cannot
alter the demands of the Fifth and Sixth Amendments, neither may
that practical concern, “of which earlier courts were well aware.”
Apprendi, 530 U. S., at 521 (Thomas, J., concurring).
It is hard not to wonder, too: Are we really to suppose that the
amici supporting Mr. Erlinger in this Court, including the
National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers and the National
Association of Federal Defenders, have been “somehow duped” into
advocating for a rule that would be “unfair to criminal
defendants”? Blakely, 542 U. S., at 312; see also NAFD
Brief 25; Brief for National Association of Criminal Defense
Lawyers as Amicus Curiae 16–17.

															Of course not. As these groups stress, and the
government agrees, traditional tools exist to address the
prejudicial effect evidence about a defendant’s past crimes can
have on a jury. Most obviously, a court can bifurcate the
proceedings. In that “common,” Apprendi, 530 U. S., at
521, n. 10 (Thomas, J., concurring), and often “fairest”
practice, Spencer v. Texas, 385
U.S. 554, 567 (1967), a jury is first tasked with assessing
whether the government has proved the elements of the §922(g)
felon-in-possession charge. Then, and only if it finds the
defendant guilty, the jury turns to consider evidence regarding
whether the defendant’s prior offenses occurred on different
occasions for purposes of applying ACCA’s mandatory minimum
sentence under §924(e). Justice Jackson expresses concern about the
“burdens” proceeding this way might impose. See post, at 21.
But by sequencing and separating the jury’s determinations, a court
decreases the likelihood that a jury will be
“ ‘overpersuade[d]’ ” by the defendant’s prior criminal
conduct. Post, at 22 (Jackson, J., dissenting) (quoting
Michelson v. United States, 335
U.S. 469, 476 (1948)).

															On this, all sides agree. The government reports
that it “generally agree[s] to bifurcation” in ACCA cases like this
one and that it has not “been able to anticipate as to why [it]
wouldn’t agree to bifurcation.” Tr. of Oral Arg. 58–59. Similarly,
the National Association of Federal Defenders reports that, “[t]o
[its] knowledge, every jury trial but one has been bifurcated when
the jury was permitted to decide both the §922(g)
unlawful-firearm-possession question and the §924(e) ‘occasions’
question.” NAFD Brief 26.[9]
States that “have not already done so can likewise adjust to any
state-law implications of [our] straightforward application of
Apprendi to . . . ACCA’s different-occasions
requirement.” Reply Brief 21; see also Spencer, 385
U. S., at 586 (Warren, C. J., concurring and dissenting)
(observing that, whether or not required to do so, at the time most
States had adopted “procedures which postpone the introduction of
prior convictions until after the jury has found the defendant
guilty of the crime currently charged”).[10]

															*

															The jury trial may have “never been
efficient.” Apprendi, 530 U. S., at 498 (Scalia, J.,
concurring). It may require assembling a group of the defendant’s
peers to resolve unanimously even seemingly straightforward factual
questions under a daunting reasonable doubt standard. Avoiding the
prejudice associated with the introduction of evidence of past
crimes may require careful attention, too. But the right to a jury
trial “has always been” an important part of what keeps this Nation
“free.” Ibid. Because the Fifth and Sixth Amendments do not
tolerate the denial of that right in this case, the judgment of the
Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit is vacated, and the matter
is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this
opinion.

															

															It is so ordered.

Notes
1
 Justice Jackson pursues
an argument neither the government nor amicus nor the
principal dissent attempts. She says Apprendi v. New
Jersey, 530 U.S.
466 (2000), “was wrongly decided,” and all but calls on the
Court to overturn our many precedents applying it, post, at
1, and n. 1, 10–18. But rather than meaningfully engage with
the Constitution, its original meaning and history, or our
precedents, Justice Jackson would abandon “constitutional theory”
and appeal to a different authority. Post, at 27. “In my
view,” post, at 20, Justice Jackson contends, juries cannot
“deal with the fine-grained, nuanced determinations . . . that are
necessary to fairly adjudicate factual questions like the one that
ACCA’s occasions inquiry raises,” post, at 23. But the
Constitution does not take such a dim view about the capacity of
jurors or the rigors of trial. Surely, too, juries are no less
capable than judges to decide whether three past events happened on
three separate occasions. Day in and day out, using everyday trial
procedures, juries decide exponentially more complex questions than
that. Nor, of course, does Apprendi prohibit legislatures
from enacting reforms authorizing judges to lower sentences
based on their own factfinding. See, e.g., First Step Act of
2018, Pub. L. 115–391, 132Stat. 5194; 18 U. S. C.
§3553(f ) (doing just that). The only thing judges may not do
consistent with Apprendi is increase a defendant’s
exposure to punishment based on their own factfinding. All of which
leaves Justice Jackson with her real complaint: In her view, it is
“wildly inefficient” to require the government to call witnesses
and present evidence—which is to say prove its case—when a judge
might more easily enhance a defendant’s exposure to punishment by
consulting “sometimes-decades-old,” post, at 23, and
error-prone court records, infra, at 17–19. But does Justice
Jackson really think it too much to ask the government to prove its
case (as it concedes it must) with reliable evidence before seeking
enhanced punishments under a statute like ACCA when the “practical
realit[y]” for defendants like Mr. Erlinger is exposure to an
additional decade (or more) in prison? Post, at 27. Justice
Jackson may view juries as “roadblocks” to higher punishments.
Post, at 18. But “[t]he bottom line is this”: the people
ratified the Fifth and Sixth Amendments, not any of our personal
views. Post, at 27.

 See Pereida v.
Wilkinson, 592 U.S. 224, 238 (2021); United States v.

opinion); Descamps v. United States, 570 U.S.

542 U.S.
296, 301 (2004); Apprendi v. New Jersey,
530
U.S. 466, 490 (2000). The principal dissent complains that some
of these decisions “did not involve recidivism” questions.
Post, at 7 (opinion of Kavanaugh, J.). But surely our
consistent explanations of Almendarez-Torres’s reach cannot
be so casually dismissed. Perhaps especially when those
explanations were repeated in multiple cases that did
“involve recidivism,” such as Shepard, Descamps, and
Mathis.
3
 The principal dissent
dismisses our precedents restricting the materials and facts judges
can consider on the ground that those decisions did not “purpor[t]
to articulate any Sixth Amendment holding.” Post, at 8
(opinion of Kavanaugh, J.). But, as the government recognizes, this
Court did address the Sixth Amendment and “meant what it said.” See
Reply Brief for United States 7. As the Court has said before and
we hold again today: “[A] judge cannot go beyond identifying the
crime of conviction to explore the manner in which the defendant
committed that offense. . . . He can do no more,
consistent with the Sixth Amendment, than determine what crime,
with what elements, the defendant was convicted of.” Mathis
v. United States, 579 U.S. 500, 511–512 (2016).
4
 The principal dissent
stresses that, despite our repeated admonitions about the
limitations associated with the use of Shepard materials,
“all 12 Courts of Appeals” have permitted judges to use them to
resolve the occasions inquiry. Post, at 6 (opinion of
Kavanaugh, J.). But most of the decisions the dissent cites issued
before Wooden’s clarification about the nature of the
occasions inquiry, a clarification even the government now
recognizes means a jury is required. And to the extent some lower
courts have continued to allow judges to resolve occasions
inquiries even after Wooden v. United States, 595
U.S. 360 (2022), it seems confusion about Almendarez-Torres
has played a role in their misapprehension about what the
Constitution requires. See, e.g., United States v.
Stowell, 82 F. 4th 607, 611 (CA8 2023) (en banc)
(Erickson, J., dissenting) (criticizing the majority for treating
as “a foregone conclusion” that a judge may continue to find facts
not proved to the jury to decide the occasions inquiry); United
States v. Brown, 77 F. 4th 301, 301–302 (CA4 2023)
(statement of Heytens, J.) (noting the “uncertain scope of
Almendarez-Torres”); id., at 302 (Niemeyer, J.,
concurring in part) (conceding “different approach[es]” exist “as
to the scope of Almendarez-Torres”); id., at 303
(Wynn, J., dissenting from denial of rehearing en banc)
(questioning “the continuing viability of
Almendarez-Torres”); see also United States v.
Dudley, 5 F. 4th 1249, 1278 (CA11 2021) (Newsom, J.,
concurring in part and dissenting in part).

 Amicus emphasizes
that supplemental-information procedures became more “widely
adopted” in the 1920s after Graham. Brief for
Court-Appointed Amicus Curiae 16. But, since
Apprendi, this Court has insisted on “remain[ing] true” to
the Fifth and Sixth Amendment’s original meaning and protecting the
rights they secure against “ ‘erosion.’ ” 530 U. S.,
at 483. Accordingly, relatively modern innovations move us little,
for they might just as well represent departures from the
Constitution’s historic protections as evidence of them.
Ibid.; accord, Gaudin, 515 U. S., at 518–519.
Nor, for that matter, does looking to more modern times do much to
help amicus. He does not dispute that, even as late as 1965,
juries usually still had to find facts about prior convictions,
whether under supplemental-information regimes or more traditional
ones. See Apprendi, 530 U. S., at 489, n. 15;

 Of the trials where
proceedings were bifurcated, the National Association of Federal
Defenders observes, some “have resulted in acquittal or dismissal”
at the first stage where prejudicial past conduct was omitted;
another has resulted in acquittal at the second stage after the
jury found the government had not carried its burden of showing the
defendant’s prior offenses were committed on separate occasions;
three others “have resulted in guilty verdicts” at both stages.
NAFD Brief 21–22.
10  Once
more parting ways with the parties and defense bar amici,
Justice Jackson asserts that Apprendi’s rule confining
judges at sentencing to the facts found by the jury hurts
defendants and makes “racial disparities” in our criminal justice
system “worse.” Post, at 16–17. As we have seen, however,
Apprendi allows judges to lower sentences based on
their own factual findings; it only prohibits judges from using
their own facts to increase a defendant’s exposure to
punishment. See n. 1, supra. As the defense bar
amici are quick to point out, that helps defendants. It
seems, too, Justice Jackson has directed her fire at the wrong
target. The reports and law review article cited by Justice Jackson
attribute sentencing disparities to this Court’s remedial decision
in United States v. Booker, 543
U.S. 220, 245–246 (2005), as well as various other factors:
judges, “prosecutors, law enforcement officials, probation officers
. . . , overworked defense attorneys, and other
actors involved in maintaining the court system.” K. Klein & S.

Transformed the Federal Sentencing Guidelines into a Series of
Judicial Obstacles; Can Shame Reduce the Racial Disparities?, 99
N. C. L. Rev. 1391, 1405, 1423 (2021). And, unlike
Justice Jackson, the authors of the very article she cites
“celebrate Apprendi” because, in their view, it
“unequivocally” gives a “bargaining chip” to defendants to seek
more favorable plea offers. Id., at 1399, and n. 33;
see Blakely, 542 U. S., at 311–313.
