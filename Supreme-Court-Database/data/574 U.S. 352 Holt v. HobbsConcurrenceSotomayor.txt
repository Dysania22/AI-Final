															SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

															GREGORY HOUSTON HOLT, aka ABDUL MAALIK MUHAMMAD, PETITIONER
v. RAY HOBBS, DIRECTOR, ARKANSAS DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTION,
et al.

															on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for
the eighth circuit

															[January 20, 2015]

															Justice Sotomayor, concurring.

															I concur in the Court’s opinion, which holds that the Department
failed to show why the less restrictive al-ternatives identified by
petitioner in the course of this litigation were inadequate to
achieve the Department’s compelling security-related interests. I
write separatelyto explain my understanding of the applicable
legalstandard.

															Nothing in the Court’s opinion calls into question our prior
holding in Cutter v. Wilkinson that “[c]ontext
matters” in the application of the Religious Land Use and
Institutionalized Persons Act of 2000 (RLUIPA),114Stat.803,42
U. S. C. §2000cc et seq. 544 U. S.
709,723 (2005) (internal quotation marks omitted). In the dangerous
prison environment, “regulations and procedures” are needed to
“maintain good order, security and discipline, consistent with
consideration of costs and limited resources.” Ibid. Of
course, that is not to say that cost alone is an absolute defense
to an otherwise meritorious RLUIPA claim. See §2000cc–3(c). Thus,
we recognized “that prison security is a compelling state interest,
and that deference is due to institutional officials’ expertise in
this area.” Cutter, 544 U. S., at 725, n. 13.

															I do not understand the Court’s opinion to preclude deferring to
prison officials’ reasoning when that deference is due—that is,
when prison officials offer a plausible explanation for their
chosen policy that is supported by whatever evidence is reasonably
available to them. But the deference that must be “extend[ed to]
the experience and expertise of prison administrators does not
extend so far that prison officials may declare a compelling
governmental interest by fiat.” Yellowbear v.
Lampert, 741 F. 3d 48, 59 (CA10 2014). Indeed, prison
policies “ ‘grounded on mere speculation’ ” are exactly
the ones that motivated Congress to enact RLUIPA. 106 Cong.
Rec. 16699 (2000) (quoting S. Rep. No. 103–111, 10
(1993)).

															Here, the Department’s failure to demonstrate why the less
restrictive policies petitioner identified in the course of the
litigation were insufficient to achieve its compelling
interests—not the Court’s independent judgment concerning the merit
of these alternative approaches—is ultimately fatal to the
Department’s position. The Court is appro-priately skeptical of the
relationship between the De-partment’s no-beard policy and its
alleged compelling interests because the Department offered little
more than unsupported assertions in defense of its refusal of
petitioner’s requested religious accommodation. RLUIPA requires
more.

															One final point bears emphasis. RLUIPA requires institutions
refusing an accommodation to demonstrate that the policy it defends
“is the least restrictive means of furthering [the alleged]
compelling . . . interest[s].” §2000cc–1(a)(2); see also
Washington v. Klem, 497 F. 3d 272, 284 (CA3
2007) (“[T]he phrase ‘least restrictive means’ is, by definition, a
relative term. It necessarily implies a comparison with other
means”); Couch v. Jabe, 679 F. 3d 197, 203 (CA4
2012) (same). But nothing in the Court’s opinion suggests that
prison officials must refute every conceivable option to satisfy
RLUIPA’s least restrictive means requirement. Nor does it intimate
that officials must prove that they considered less restrictive
alternatives at a particular point in time. Instead, the Court
correctly notes that the Department inadequately responded to the
less restrictive policies that petitioner brought to the
Department’s attention during the course of the litigation,
including the more permissive policies used by the prisons in New
York and California. See, e.g., United States v.
Wilgus, 638 F. 3d 1274, 1289 (CA10 2011) (observing in
the analogous context of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of
1993 that the government need not “do the impossible—refute each
and every conceivable alternative regulation scheme” but need only
“refute the alternative schemes offered by the challenger”).

															Because I understand the Court’s opinion to be consistent with
the foregoing, I join it.
