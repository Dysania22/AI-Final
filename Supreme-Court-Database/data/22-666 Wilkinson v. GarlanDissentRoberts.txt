															SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

															_________________

															No. 22–666

															_________________

															Situ Kamu Wilkinson, PETITIONER v.
Merrick B. Garland, Attorney General

															on writ of certiorari to the united states
court of appeals for the third circuit

															[March 19, 2024]

															

															Chief Justice Roberts, dissenting.

															I joined the opinion of the Court in
Guerrero-Lasprilla v. Barr, 589 U.S. 221 (2020), and
continue to believe that it was correctly decided. I agree with
Justice Alito’s dissent in this case, however, that the Court errs
in reading the language in Guerrero-Lasprilla “as broadly as
possible,” indeed “to the outer limits of its possible reach.”
Post, at 6, 5. Nothing in Guerrero-Lasprilla requires
such a reading, and I accordingly join Justice Alito’s dissent.
