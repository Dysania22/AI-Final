															HALIMA TARIFFA CULLEY, et al.,
PETITIONERS v. STEVEN T. MARSHALL, ATTORNEY GENERAL OF
ALABAMA, et al.

															on writ of certiorari to the united states
court of appeals for the eleventh circuit

															[May 9, 2024]

															

															Justice Kavanaugh delivered the opinion of the
Court.

															When police seize and then seek civil forfeiture
of a car that was used to commit a drug offense, the Constitution
requires a timely forfeiture hearing. The question here is whether
the Constitution also requires a separate preliminary hearing to
determine whether the police may retain the car pending the
forfeiture hearing. This Court’s precedents establish that the
answer is no: The Constitution requires a timely forfeiture
hearing; the Constitution does not also require a separate
preliminary hearing.

															I

															Halima Culley loaned her car to her
college-aged son. On February 17, 2019, police officers in Satsuma,
Alabama, stopped the car while the son was driving, and the
officers discovered marijuana and a loaded handgun in the car. The
officers arrested Culley’s son and charged him with possessing
marijuana. The officers also seized the car incident to the
arrest.

															At about the same time in 2019, Lena Sutton
loaned her car to a friend. On February 21, 2019, police officers
in Leesburg, Alabama, stopped the car while Sutton’s friend was
driving, and the officers discovered a large amount of
methamphetamine in the car. The officers arrested Sutton’s friend
and charged him with trafficking methamphetamine and possessing
drug paraphernalia. The officers also seized the car incident to
the arrest.

															At the time of the seizures of the two cars,
Alabama law authorized the civil forfeiture of a car used to commit
or facilitate a drug crime. See Ala. Code §20–2–93(a)(5) (2015).
Officers could seize the car “incident to an arrest” so long as the
State then “promptly” initiated a forfeiture case. §20–2–93(b)(1),
(c). In the interim before the forfeiture hearing, the car’s owner
could recover it by posting bond at double the car’s value. See
§20–2–93(h); §28–4–287 (2013). At the forfeiture hearing, the owner
could prevail and recover the car under Alabama’s “affirmative
defense” for “innocent owners of property subject to forfeiture.”
Wallace v. State, 229 So. 3d 1108, 1110 (Ala. Civ.
App. 2017). That defense required the owner to show that the owner
lacked knowledge of the car’s connection to the drug crime. See
Ala. Code §20–2–93(h) (2015).

															The State of Alabama filed a forfeiture
complaint against Culley’s car on February 27, 2019, just 10 days
after the seizure of the car. But Culley waited six months before
answering that complaint. And she waited another year—until
September 21, 2020—before raising an innocent owner defense in a
motion for summary judgment. Soon thereafter, on October 30, 2020,
an Alabama state court granted Culley’s motion and ordered the
return of her car.

															Sutton similarly moved slowly in her forfeiture
proceeding. Alabama brought a forfeiture case against Sutton’s car
on March 6, 2019, just 13 days after the seizure of the car. Sutton
initially failed to appear in the case, causing the state court to
enter a default judgment for Alabama. Sutton later requested that
the state court set aside that judgment, and the state court did
so. Sutton then submitted a brief answer and served discovery
requests on Alabama, but Sutton otherwise took no action until the
state court set a date for the forfeiture trial. On April 10, 2020,
three weeks before the scheduled trial date, Sutton finally moved
for summary judgment on the ground that she was an innocent owner.
Soon thereafter, on May 28, 2020, the state court granted her
motion, and she recovered her car.

															While those forfeiture cases were ongoing,
Culley and Sutton filed purported class-action complaints in
federal court. Culley sued in the U. S. District Court for the
Southern District of Alabama. Sutton sued in the U. S.
District Court for the Northern District of Alabama. Both sought
money damages under 42 U. S. C. §1983, claiming that the
state officials violated their due process rights by retaining
their cars during the forfeiture process without holding
preliminary hearings. Culley and Sutton argued that a preliminary
hearing (also referred to as a retention hearing) is required under
the Mathews v. Eldridge due process test, which
balances the private interests at stake, the value of added
procedures, and the burdens on the government from the added
procedures. See 424
U.S. 319, 334–335 (1976).

															The District Court for the Southern District of
Alabama dismissed Culley’s complaint. Culley v.
Marshall, Civ. Action No. 19–701 (Sept. 29, 2021), App. to
Pet. for Cert. 58a. Relying on this Court’s decisions in United
States v. $8,850, 461 U.S.
555 (1983), and United States v. Von Neumann,
474 U.S.
242 (1986), the District Court held that due process requires a
timely forfeiture hearing but not a separate preliminary hearing.
See App. to Pet. for Cert. 44a–46a. The District Court then
assessed the timeliness of Culley’s forfeiture hearing under the
four-factor test set forth in $8,850, which looks to
(i) the length of the delay of the forfeiture hearing,
(ii) the reason for the delay, (iii) whether the claimant
requested a timely hearing, and (iv) whether the delay was
prejudicial. See id., at 46a–47a (citing $8,850, 461
U. S., at 563–565). The District Court concluded that Culley’s
forfeiture hearing was timely under those factors because she
played a “significant role” in delaying her own case. App. to Pet.
for Cert. 47a.

															The District Court for the Northern District of
Alabama similarly entered summary judgment against Sutton on her
due process claim. Sutton v. Leesburg, Civ. Action
No. 20–91 (Sept. 13, 2021), App. to Pet. for Cert. 71a. The
District Court determined that Sutton’s claim depended on whether
she received a timely forfeiture hearing within the meaning of
$8,850. See id., at 66a–70a. The District Court ruled
that Sutton’s forfeiture hearing was timely and satisfied due
process, in part because Sutton never asked for an earlier hearing.
See id., at 70a–71a.

															The U. S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh
Circuit consolidated the two cases and affirmed. Culley v.
Attorney General, No. 21–13805 etc. (July 11, 2022), App. to
Pet. for Cert. 1a–2a. The Court of Appeals agreed with the two
district courts that a timely forfeiture hearing affords claimants
due process and that no separate preliminary hearing is
constitutionally required. See id., at 6a–8a. The Court of
Appeals rested its conclusion on circuit precedent, which in turn
relied on this Court’s decisions in $8,850 and Von
Neumann. See ibid.

															Because of a conflict in the Courts of Appeals
over whether the Constitution requires a preliminary hearing in
civil forfeiture cases, this Court granted certiorari. See 598
U. S. ___ (2023). Compare App. to Pet. for Cert. 6a–8a, with
Ingram v. Wayne County, 81 F. 4th 603, 620 (CA6
2023); Krimstock v. Kelly, 
306 F.3d 40, 44 (CA2 2002).[1]

															II

															Under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth
Amendment as interpreted by this Court, States ordinarily may not
seize real property before providing notice and a hearing. See
United States v. James Daniel Good Real Property,
510 U.S.
43, 62 (1993). But States may immediately seize personal
property (for example, a car) that is subject to civil forfeiture
when the property otherwise could be removed, destroyed, or
concealed before a forfeiture hearing. See Calero-Toledo v.
Pearson Yacht Leasing Co., 416 U.S.
663, 679–680 (1974).

															When States seize and seek civil forfeiture of
personal property, due process requires a timely
post-seizure forfeiture hearing. See United States v. Von
Neumann, 474 U.S.
242, 247–250 (1986); United States v. $8,850,
461 U.S.
555, 562–565 (1983). In this case, petitioners Culley and
Sutton do not challenge the timeliness of their forfeiture
hearings. Rather, they argue that the Due Process Clause requires
States to also hold a separate preliminary hearing before the
forfeiture hearing.

															A

															Culley and Sutton argue that a preliminary
hearing is constitutionally necessary to determine whether States
may retain seized personal property pending the ultimate forfeiture
hearing. As petitioners envision it, the preliminary hearing would
focus on the “ ‘probable validity’ ” of the forfeiture.
Krimstock v. Kelly, 
306 F.3d 40, 48 (CA2 2002) (quoting Commissioner v.
Shapiro, 424 U.S.
614, 629 (1976)). The preliminary hearing would be adversarial,
the parties could introduce evidence and cross-examine witnesses,
and property owners could raise affirmative defenses, including
innocent ownership. In essence, the preliminary hearing would be an
earlier version of the forfeiture hearing itself.

															Alabama and its amici, including the
United States, disagree. They argue that a preliminary hearing is
not constitutionally required. To begin, they emphasize that most
States and the Federal Government do not currently provide
preliminary hearings in civil forfeiture cases. So requiring a
preliminary hearing as a matter of constitutional dictate would
necessitate a major change in the States’ and the Federal
Government’s longstanding practices. Alabama and its amici
also contend that a property owner’s post-seizure rights are
already protected by the constitutional requirement that the
forfeiture hearing be timely. They further assert that requiring a
“hearing before a hearing” in every case, as petitioners want,
would interfere with important law-enforcement activities that must
occur after the seizure and before the forfeiture hearing—including
identifying and contacting potential claimants of the property;
coordinating forfeiture proceedings with related criminal
investigations and prosecutions; and ensuring that property is not
removed, destroyed, or put to illegal use before the forfeiture
hearing.

															Ultimately, we need not reweigh the competing
due process arguments advanced by the parties because this Court’s
decisions in United States v. $8,850, 461 U.S.
555 (1983), and United States v. Von Neumann,
474 U.S.
242 (1986), already resolved the issue. After a State seizes
and seeks civil forfeiture of personal property, due process
requires a timely forfeiture hearing but does not require a
separate preliminary hearing.

															The dispute in $8,850 arose when the
Customs Service seized currency from an individual entering the
United States, but then waited before filing for civil forfeiture
of the currency. See 461 U. S., at 558–561. The property owner
argued that the delay violated due process. See id., at
562.

															This Court concluded that a post-seizure delay
“may become so prolonged that the dispossessed property owner has
been deprived of a meaningful hearing at a meaningful time.”
Id., at 562–563. The Court elaborated that timeliness in
civil forfeiture cases must be assessed by “analog[izing]
. . . to a defendant’s right to a speedy trial” and
considering four factors: the length of the delay, the reason for
the delay, whether the property owner asserted his rights, and
whether the delay was prejudicial. Id., at 564 (citing
Barker v. Wingo, 407 U.S.
514, 530 (1972)). Those factors are appropriate guides in the
civil forfeiture context, the Court explained, because the factors
ensure that “the flexible requirements of due process have been
met.” 461 U. S., at 564–565.

															In Von Neumann, the Court addressed
whether a timely forfeiture hearing, without more, provides the
process that is due in civil forfeiture cases. See 474 U. S.,
at 249–251. The property owner there failed to declare the purchase
of his new car upon driving it into the United States. See
id., at 245. A customs official determined that the car was
subject to civil forfeiture and seized it. See ibid. The
plaintiff filed a petition for remission of the forfeiture—in
essence, a request under federal law that the Federal Government
exercise its discretion to forgive the forfeiture. See id.,
at 245–246. The Government did not respond to that petition for 36
days. See id., at 246. The plaintiff sued, arguing that the
Government’s 36-day delay in answering the remission petition
violated due process. See id., at 246–247.

															Justice Brennan’s opinion for the Court broadly
held that due process did not require a pre-forfeiture-hearing
remission procedure in the first place. See id., at 249–251.
Citing $8,850, the Court ruled that a timely “forfeiture
proceeding, without more, provides the postseizure hearing required
by due process” to protect the plaintiff ’s “property interest
in the car.” 474 U. S., at 249. The Court explained that the
plaintiff ’s “right to a forfeiture proceeding” that meets the
$8,850 timeliness test “satisfies any due process right with
respect to the car.” 474 U. S., at 251. A separate remission
hearing is not “constitutionally required.” Id., at
250.[2]

															This Court’s decisions in $8,850 and
Von Neumann resolve this case. As the Court stated in Von
Neumann, a timely forfeiture hearing “satisfies any due process
right” with respect to a “car” that has been seized for civil
forfeiture. 474 U. S., at 251; see also id., at 249.
The Due Process Clause does not require a separate preliminary
hearing.[3]

															Culley and Sutton’s argument for a separate
preliminary hearing appears in many respects to be a backdoor
argument for a more timely hearing so that a property owner with a
good defense against forfeiture can recover her property more
quickly. But the Court’s precedents already require a timely
hearing, and a property owner can of course raise
$8,850-based arguments in an individual case to ensure a
timely hearing.

															Culley and Sutton (echoed by the dissent here)
try to brush aside Von Neumann on the ground that the
statutory remission procedure in that case was discretionary. See
474 U. S., at 244, and n. 2 (citing 19 U. S. C.
§1618 (1982 ed., Supp. III)); see also post, at 8–9
(Sotomayor, J., dissenting). But the discretionary nature of the
remission procedure played no role in the Court’s constitutional
analysis. See 474 U. S., at 249–251. Culley and Sutton also
try to characterize the language in Von Neumann as dicta. We
disagree. The Court ruled for the Government in Von Neumann
on the ground that a timely “forfeiture proceeding, without more,
provides the postseizure hearing required by due process” in civil
forfeiture cases. Id., at 249. No separate preliminary
hearing is constitutionally required.

															Culley and Sutton also contend that
Mathews v. Eldridge should be the test for deciding
when additional process is due and that, under Mathews, a
preliminary hearing would be required in civil forfeiture cases.
424 U.S.
319 (1976). But this Court decided $8,850 and Von
Neumann after Mathews, yet in those two cases, the Court
did not apply the Mathews test. In any event, there is no
good reason to think that the Mathews balancing test would
yield a different result here. A timely forfeiture hearing protects
the interests of both the claimant and the government. And an
additional preliminary hearing of the kind sought by petitioners
would interfere with the government’s important law-enforcement
activities in the period after the seizure and before the
forfeiture hearing.

															In arguing that the Constitution requires a
preliminary hearing, Culley and Sutton also point to this Court’s
Fourth Amendment decisions in the criminal context. That analogy is
flawed. The Fourth Amendment requires that any person who is
arrested without a warrant be brought before a neutral magistrate
within 48 hours, absent extraordinary circumstances. See County
of Riverside v. McLaughlin, 500 U.S.
44, 53, 56–57 (1991). But the Fourth Amendment hearings are not
adversarial, and they address only whether probable cause supports
the arrestee’s detention. See Gerstein v. Pugh,
420 U.S.
103, 119–122 (1975). Here, Culley and Sutton do not request a
mere probable cause hearing of the kind described in
Gerstein. Rather, they argue that the immediate seizure of
property requires adversarial preliminary hearings, and they assert
that those hearings must address their “affirmative defense” of
innocent ownership. Wallace v. State, 229 So. 3d
1108, 1110 (Ala. Civ. App. 2017). Culley and Sutton therefore
contend that the Due Process Clause requires more extensive
preliminary procedures for the temporary retention of property than
for the temporary restraint of persons. The Due Process Clause does
not demand that incongruity. See United States v.
Monsanto, 491 U.S.
600, 615–616 (1989).

															Finally, the dissent here relies heavily on
United States v. James Daniel Good Real Property,
510 U.S.
43. See post, at 10. There, this Court held that the
government must ordinarily provide notice and a hearing before
seizing real property that is subject to civil forfeiture. See 510
U. S., at 62. The Court emphasized that real property, unlike
personal property, “can be neither moved nor concealed” during the
forfeiture process. Id., at 52–53; see also id., at
56–57. That case did not purport to disturb the rule that the
government may seize and retain personal property, such as a car,
that is subject to civil forfeiture when the property otherwise
could be removed, destroyed, or concealed before a forfeiture
hearing. See id., at 57 (citing Calero-Toledo, 416
U. S., at 679). And more to the point, that case did not alter
Von Neumann’s holding that a timely forfeiture hearing
provides the process that is due following the immediate seizure of
personal property.

															In sum, Von Neumann held that a timely
forfeiture hearing satisfies due process in civil forfeiture cases,
and $8,850 specified the standard for when forfeiture
hearings are timely. Culley and Sutton have not asked the Court to
discard those precedents in this case. And those precedents make
crystal clear that due process does not require a separate
preliminary hearing before the forfeiture hearing.

															B

															Historical practice reinforces the holdings of
$8,850 and Von Neumann that due process does not
require preliminary hearings in civil forfeiture cases.

															Since the Founding era, statutes have authorized
the Government to seize personal property and hold it pending a
forfeiture hearing, without a separate preliminary hearing. For
example, the first federal forfeiture law, the Collection Act of
1789, authorized the civil forfeiture of ships, goods, and
merchandise involved in suspected violations of the customs laws.
See, e.g., Act of July 31, 1789, ch. 5, §§12, 22–24,
34, 1Stat. 29, 39, 42–43, 46; see generally C. Nelson, The
Constitutionality of Civil Forfeiture, 125 Yale L. J. 2446,
2464–2466 (2016). The Act’s forfeiture process began with the
seizure of property by a customs collector. See,
e.g., §25, 1Stat. 43. The collector then filed a
forfeiture action, which a court would “hear and determine
. . . according to law.” §36, id., at 47. While
that action was pending, the seized property could “remain in the
custody of the collector.” §25, id., at 43. A claimant could
also recover the property on bond. See §36, id., at 47.

															The Collection Act did not require a separate
preliminary hearing before the forfeiture hearing. Rather, the
forfeiture “trial” supplied the opportunity for the property owner
to challenge the collector’s case. Ibid.

															In 1790 and 1799, Congress revised and reenacted
the Collection Act. See Act of Mar. 2, 1799, ch. 22, 1Stat. 627;
Act of Aug. 4, 1790, ch. 35, 1Stat. 145. The revised versions of
the Act contained similar forfeiture provisions and likewise lacked
anything resembling a separate preliminary hearing. See,
e.g., Act of Mar. 2, 1799, §§69, 89, 1Stat. 678,
695–696; Act of Aug. 4, 1790, §§49, 67, 1 Stat. 170, 176–177.

															Many state forfeiture statutes from the Founding
period similarly did not require a preliminary hearing before the
forfeiture hearing. See, e.g., Act of Apr. 11, 1787,
ch. 81, in 2 Laws of the State of New York Passed at the Sessions
of the Legislature Held in the Years 1785, 1786, 1787 and 1788,
Inclusive pp. 514–515, 517–520 (1886); Act of Oct. 1785, ch. 14, in
12 The Statutes at Large; Being a Collection of All the Laws of
Virginia, from the First Session of the Legislature, in the Year
1619 pp. 46–47 (1823). For example, a New York customs statute from
that era provided that a property owner could recover his seized
goods by either prevailing at a forfeiture “trial” or executing a
“bond” for an appraised amount. Act of Apr. 11, 1787, at 517–518.
The statute did not allow property owners to challenge the validity
of the seizure through a separate preliminary hearing or any
similar procedure. See id., at 517–520.

															In addition, when the Fourteenth Amendment was
ratified in 1868, Congress did not require preliminary hearings. In
1864, for example, Congress provided that goods seized under a new
revenue law should “remain” in the “care and custody” of the
government “until final judgment” in a forfeiture trial. Act of
Mar. 7, 1864, ch. 20, §2, 13Stat. 14, 15. Although that revenue law
provided for bond, it did not grant property owners a right to
preliminary hearings. See ibid. Similarly, in 1866, Congress
required that goods and vessels seized under a new customs law
“remain in the custody” of a customs official pending “adjudication
by the proper tribunal.” Act of July 18, 1866, ch. 201, §31,
14Stat. 178, 186.

															Many state forfeiture laws from around the time
of the Fourteenth Amendment likewise did not provide for a
preliminary hearing. For example, a New Hampshire statute required
that a state official “detain” personal property that was seized
for civil forfeiture until the property was “legally disposed
of ” through either bond or a forfeiture trial. The General
Statutes of the State of New-Hampshire, ch. 249, §§3, 6–7, pp.
503–504 (1867). Likewise, a Vermont statute authorized the seizure
of liquor that was intended for sale, required the seizing officer
to “keep” the liquor “until final action is had thereon,” and
limited the conditions in which a claimant could recover the
liquor. The Revised Laws of Vermont, 1880, §3818, p. 738 (1881);
see §3827, id., at 740.

															Petitioners and their amici do not
identify any federal or state statutes that, before the late 20th
century, required preliminary hearings in civil forfeiture cases.
To be sure, some States have recently enacted laws requiring
preliminary hearings in civil forfeiture cases. See, e.g.,
Ala. Act 2021–497, p. 9; 2021 Minn. Laws pp. 2064–2065; 2017 Ill.
Laws pp. 6854–6855; 2017 Wis. Laws p. 815; 2012 Colo. Sess. Laws
pp. 856–857; 2001 N. C. Sess. Laws p. 1159. But those recent
laws do not support a constitutional mandate for preliminary
hearings in every State.

															In short, both Congress and the States have long
authorized law enforcement to seize personal property and hold it
until a forfeiture hearing. The absence of separate preliminary
hearings in civil forfeiture proceedings—from the Founding until
the late 20th century—is weighty evidence that due process does not
require such hearings. Cf. United States v. Ursery,
518 U.S.
267, 274, 287–288 (1996); Bennis v. Michigan,
516 U.S.
442, 446–448 (1996); Calero-Toledo, 416 U. S., at
680–690. The historical practice in civil forfeiture proceedings
thus reinforces $8,850 and Von Neumann: In civil
forfeiture cases involving personal property such as cars, the Due
Process Clause requires a timely forfeiture hearing but does not
require a preliminary hearing.

															*  *  *

															To balance the interests of the government and
individuals in civil forfeiture cases involving personal property,
the States and Congress have adopted a wide variety of approaches.
For example, some States require that the forfeiture hearing occur
within a fixed period of time. Others require a jury trial. Still
others condition civil forfeiture on a successful criminal
prosecution. And a few now require preliminary hearings. See Brief
for State of Georgia et al. as Amici Curiae 5–21.

															Our decision today does not preclude those
legislatively prescribed innovations. Rather, our decision simply
addresses the baseline protection of the Due Process Clause.

															In civil forfeiture cases, the Due Process
Clause requires a timely forfeiture hearing, but does not require a
separate preliminary hearing. We affirm the judgment of the
U. S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit.

															It is so ordered.

Notes
1
 Before the entry of
judgment by the Court of Appeals, Alabama amended its forfeiture
laws to allow an innocent owner to request an “expedited hearing”
“at any time after seizure of property and before entry of a
conviction” in a “related criminal case.” Ala. Code §15–5–63(3)
(2018); §20–2–93(l) (Supp. 2023); see also Ala. Act 2021–497
(effective Jan. 1, 2022). That amendment did not moot this case
because Culley’s and Sutton’s requested relief includes money
damages against the municipalities of Satsuma and Leesburg. See
Culley v. Attorney General, No. 21–13805 etc., App.
to Pet. for Cert. 6a.

 At oral argument in
Von Neumann, Justice O’Connor asked the United States
whether the “forfeiture proceeding itself provides all the process
that’s due” to protect the “property interest in the car.” Tr. of
Oral Arg. in United States v. Von Neumann, O. T.
1985, No. 84–1144, p. 18. The United States answered, “that is
our position.” Ibid.; see also id., at 26–27. The
Court subsequently agreed with that position. See Von
Neumann, 474 U. S., at 249–251.

 In this opinion, we do
not address any due process issues related to civil forfeiture
other than the question about a separate preliminary
hearing.
