															SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

															_________________

															No. 22–1078

															_________________

															WARNER CHAPPELL MUSIC, INC., et al.,
PETITIONERS v. SHERMAN NEALY, et al.

															on writ of certiorari to the united states
court of appeals for the eleventh circuit

															[May 9, 2024]

															

															Justice Gorsuch, with whom Justice Thomas and
Justice Alito join, dissenting.

															The Court discusses how a discovery rule of
accrual should operate under the Copyright Act. But in doing so it
sidesteps the logically antecedent question whether the Act has
room for such a rule. Rather than address that question, the Court
takes care to emphasize that its resolution must await a future
case. The trouble is, the Act almost certainly does not tolerate a
discovery rule. And that fact promises soon enough to make anything
we might say today about the rule’s operational details a dead
letter.

															“[O]rdinarily,” this Court has said, a claim
“accrues when a plaintiff has a complete and present cause of
action.” Petrella v. Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Inc.,
572 U.S.
663, 670 (2014) (internal quotation marks and alteration
omitted). “In other words, the limitations period generally begins
to run at the point when the plaintiff can file suit and obtain
relief.” Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted). We call
this the “incident of injury rule.” Ibid., n. 4. And we
interpret statutes with that “ ‘standard rule’ ” in mind.
Rotkiske v. Klemm, 589 U.S. 8, 13 (2019).

															What of the discovery rule? It “starts the
limitations period when the plaintiff discovers, or with due
diligence should have discovered, the injury that forms the basis
for the claim.” Petrella, 572 U. S., at 670, n. 4
(internal quotation marks omitted). We have said, however,
that the rule is not “applicable across all contexts.” TRW
Inc. v. Andrews, 534 U.S.
19, 27 (2001). Far from it: Unless the statute at hand directs
otherwise, we proceed consistent with traditional equitable
practice and ordinarily apply the discovery rule only “in cases of
fraud or concealment.” Ibid. We have long warned lower
courts, too, against taking any more “expansive approach to the
discovery rule.” Rotkiske, 589 U. S., at 14; see TRW
Inc., 534 U. S., at 27–28.

															There is little reason to suppose the Copyright
Act’s provisions at issue in this case contemplate any departure
from the usual rules. Section 507(b) provides that “[n]o civil
action shall be maintained . . . unless it is commenced
within three years after the claim accrued.” As the Court observed
in Petrella v. Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Inc., standard
language like that calls for the application of the standard
incident of injury rule: “A copyright claim thus arises or
‘accrue[s]’ when an infringing act occurs,” not at some later date.
572 U. S., at 670. What this should mean for the case before
us seems equally evident: Because everyone agrees Sherman Nealy
filed suit more than three years after many of Warner Chappell’s
alleged infringing acts, see ante, at 2, some (if not all)
of his claims are untimely. Everyone agrees, too, that he has not
alleged any fraud or concealment that would entitle him to
equitable tolling. See Brief for Petitioners 39; Brief for
Respondents 50–51. The discovery rule thus has no role to play
here—or, indeed, in the mine run of copyright cases.

															In one sense, the Court’s decision to pass over
this complication may be understandable. After all, none of the
parties before us questioned the application of a discovery rule in
proceedings below, but joined issue only over how it should work.
See ante, at 5, n. 1. And the Court may, as it does,
resolve the parties’ dispute while leaving for another day the
antecedent question whether a discovery rule exists under the Act.
See ante, at 4–5.

															But if that is a permissible course, it does not
strike me as the most sensible one. Nothing requires us to play
along with these particular parties and expound on the details of a
rule of law that they may assume but very likely does not exist.
Respectfully, rather than devote our time to this case, I would
have dismissed it as improvidently granted and awaited another
squarely presenting the question whether the Copyright Act
authorizes the discovery rule. Better, in my view, to answer a
question that does matter than one that almost certainly does
not.
