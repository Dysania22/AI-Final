															SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

															_________________

															No. 22–982

															_________________

															RYAN THORNELL, DIRECTOR, ARIZONA DEPARTMENT OF
CORRECTIONS, PETITIONER v. DANNY LEE JONES

															on writ of certiorari to the united states
court of appeals for the ninth circuit

															[May 30, 2024]

															

															Justice Sotomayor, with whom Justice Kagan
joins, dissenting.

															I agree with the Court that “the Ninth Circuit
all but ignored the strong aggravating circumstances in this case.”
Ante, at 1. That was error. As part of the prejudice inquiry
for ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claims, courts must “consider
all the evidence—the good and the bad,” Wong v.
Belmontes, 558 U.S.
15, 26 (2009) (per curiam), and must “reweigh the
evidence in aggravation against the totality of available
mitigating evidence,” Wiggins v. Smith, 539 U.S.
510, 534 (2003).

															The majority unnecessarily goes further and
engages in the reweighing itself. See ante, at 8–14. The
record in this case is complex, contested, and thousands of pages
long. In light of this “extensive record” and “intricate procedural
history, . . . this is not an appropriate case to reach
and settle [a] fact-sensitive issue.” CRST Van Expedited,
Inc. v. EEOC, 578 U.S. 419, 435 (2016). That is
particularly true when, as here, the majority in the first instance
parses a complex record containing contested medical diagnoses and
disputed allegations of abuse and trauma.

															“It is not the Court’s usual practice to
adjudicate either legal or predicate factual questions in the first
instance.” Ibid.; see also Cutter v.
Wilkinson, 544 U.S.
709, 718, n. 7 (2005) (“[W]e are a court of review, not first
view”). Because I would vacate the judgment below and remand for
the Ninth Circuit to consider the full record in the first
instance, I respectfully dissent.
