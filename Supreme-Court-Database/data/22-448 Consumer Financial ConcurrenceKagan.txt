															SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

															CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION BUREAU, et al.,
PETITIONERS v. COMMUNITY FINANCIAL SERVICES ASSOCIATION OF
AMERICA, LIMITED, et al.

															on writ of certiorari to the united states
court of appeals for the fifth circuit

															[May 16, 2024]

															

															Justice Kagan, with whom Justice Sotomayor,
Justice Kavanaugh, and Justice Barrett join, concurring.

															I join in full the Court’s opinion holding that
the funding mechanism for the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau
complies with the Appropriations Clause. As the Court details, that
conclusion emerges from the Clause’s “text, the history against
which that text was enacted, and congressional practice immediately
following ratification.” Ante, at 6. At its inception, the
Clause required only that Congress “identify a source of public
funds and authorize the expenditure of those funds for designated
purposes.” Ibid. The Clause otherwise granted Congress “a
wide range of discretion.” Ante, at 12. The result was
“significant variety” in appropriations—most notably, as to their
specificity, duration, and funding source. Ante, at 15; see
ante, at 12–15. The CFPB’s funding scheme, if transplanted
back to the late-18th century, would have fit right in.

															I write separately to note that the same would
have been true at any other time in our Nation’s history.
“ ‘Long settled and established practice’ may have ‘great
weight’ ” in interpreting constitutional provisions about the
operation of government. Chiafalo v. Washington, 591
U.S. 578, 592–593 (2020) (quoting The Pocket Veto Case,
279 U.S.
655, 689 (1929)); see also The Federalist No. 37, p. 229 (C.
Rossiter ed. 1961). And here just such a tradition supports
everything the Court says about the Appropriations Clause’s
meaning. The founding-era practice that the Court relates became
the 19th-century practice, which became the 20th-century practice,
which became today’s. For over 200 years now, Congress has
exercised broad discretion in crafting appropriations. Sometimes it
has authorized the expenditure of a sum certain for an itemized
purpose on an annual basis. And sometimes it has departed from that
model in one or more ways. All the flexibility and diversity
evident in the founding period has thus continued unabated, making
it ever more obvious that the CFPB’s funding accords with the
Constitution.

															For one thing, Congress has never thought it
necessary to designate specific amounts for specific items. Over
the years, many appropriations have instead given the Executive
leeway to decide how to allocate funds, up to a ceiling, among a
set of activities. As the Court shows, the First Congress made
appropriations of “sums not exceeding” stated amounts for “broad
categories” of purposes; the Executive then decided the level of
funding it would use for all things within a category. Ante,
at 12, 13. In instituting those “lump-sum grants,” the First
Congress created a template for later ones to follow. Ante,
at 12. Examples of such grants “abound in our history.”
Clinton v. City of New York, 524
U.S. 417, 467 (1998) (Scalia, J., concurring in part and
dissenting in part). During the Civil War, Congress authorized the
allocation of $76.5 million for various expenses “as the exigencies
of the [Army] may require.” Act of Feb. 25, 1862, ch. 32, 12Stat.
344–345. In the Depression, Congress made $950 million available
“for such projects and/or purposes” as the President “in his
discretion may prescribe.” Act of Feb. 15, 1934, ch. 13, 48Stat.
351. More recent examples include an appropriation not to exceed
$135 million for uses that the Secretaries of Defense and Energy
determine are “necessary for Atomic Energy Defense Activities.” Act
of Nov. 29, 1989, §1605(a), 103Stat. 1598. The constitutionality of
such measures, Justice Scalia observed, “has never seriously been
questioned”—in part because of their prevalence. Clinton,
524 U. S., at 467. Our government practice has been “replete
with instances of general appropriations” to be “expended as
directed by designated government agencies.” Cincinnati Soap
Co. v. United States, 301 U.S.
308, 322 (1937). The CFPB’s authority to take and allocate
moneys up to a statutory cap is just one more instance to add to
the list.

															Similarly, Congress has never thought
appropriations must be annual, or even time-limited.
(Appropriations that are time-limited themselves show
variety: Most are annual, but some last for longer periods—say, two
or five years.[1]*) “Standing”
appropriations—those making funds “always available for specified
purposes” without “requir[ing] repeated [legislative] action”—have
a long history. GAO, Principles of Federal Appropriations Law, p.
2–10 (rev. 4th ed. 2016). As the Court notes, the First Congress,
by setting up fee-based schemes, provided the Customs Service and
Post Office with indefinite funding. See ante, at 13–14, 17.
And in doing so, that Congress again inspired its successors.
Standing appropriations proliferated during the 19th century; by
1880, 138 statutes making them were on the books. See S. Rep.
No. 334, 46th Cong., 2d Sess., 4–7 (1880) (listing statutes). And
the growth has not stopped: By Fiscal Year 2022, spending that does
not require periodic appropriations (whether annual or longer)
accounted for nearly two-thirds of the federal budget. See
Congressional Budget Office, The Accuracy of CBO’s Budget
Projections for Fiscal Year 2022, p. 3 (Jan. 2023). Frequently,
too, standing appropriations do not designate specific sums of
money, thus combining one type of flexibility with another. They
instead may provide the sums “necessary for purposes of ” a
program—such as to provide unemployment assistance or give
scholarships to veterans’ dependents. 15 U. S. C.
§9023(d)(3); see 20 U. S. C. §1070h(f ). So again,
Congress’s non-time-limited grant to the CFPB for amounts (up to a
cap) “reasonably necessary to carry out” its duties falls within an
established tradition. 12 U. S. C. §5497(a).

															And “flexible approaches to appropriations” have
been particularly common in the sphere of financial regulation.
Ante, at 13. There, Congress’s adoption of assessment-based
funding mechanisms (similar to those the First Congress used for
the Customs Service and Post Office, see supra, at 3) has
meant that regulators do not have to seek yearly legislative
funding. And they generally may devote the funds they collect to
any of a range of activities. For example, the Office of the
Comptroller of the Currency has authority to levy assessments on
banks as “necessary or appropriate to carry out [its]
responsibilities.” 12 U. S. C. §16; see also Act of Feb.
19, 1875, ch. 89, 18Stat. 329. Similarly, the Federal Reserve Board
assesses Federal Reserve Banks for whatever amount is “sufficient
to pay its estimated expenses.” 12 U. S. C. §243; see
also Federal Reserve Act, 38Stat. 261 (1913). Indeed, not a single
federal bank regulator is currently, or has been for a long while,
funded by standard congressional appropriations. The CFPB received
from those regulators most of the powers it wields today. So it is
not surprising that the CFPB also inherited a bank-funded scheme
enabling it to allocate moneys, at its own discretion, to carry out
its responsibilities.

															I would therefore add one more point to the
Court’s opinion. As the Court describes, the Appropriations
Clause’s text and founding-era history support the
constitutionality of the CFPB’s funding. See ante, at 6. And
so too does a continuing tradition. Throughout our history,
Congress has created a variety of mechanisms to pay for government
operations. Some schemes specified amounts to go to designated
items; others left greater discretion to the Executive. Some were
limited in duration; others were permanent. Some relied on general
Treasury moneys; others designated alternative sources of funds.
Whether or not the CFPB’s mechanism has an exact replica, its
essentials are nothing new. And it was devised more than two
centuries into an unbroken congressional practice, beginning at the
beginning, of innovation and adaptation in appropriating funds. The
way our Government has actually worked, over our entire experience,
thus provides another reason to uphold Congress’s decision about
how to fund the CFPB.
