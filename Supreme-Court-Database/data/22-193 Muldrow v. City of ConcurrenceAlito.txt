															SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

															_________________

															No. 22–193

															_________________

															Jatonya Clayborn Muldrow, PETITIONER v.
City of St. Louis, Missouri, et al.

															on writ of certiorari to the united states
court of appeals for the eighth circuit

															[April 17, 2024]

															

															Justice Alito, concurring in the judgment.

															I agree with the judgment in this case. Assuming
without deciding that all the facts mentioned by the Court are
relevant and properly presented, petitioner’s transfer altered the
“terms” or “conditions” of her employment, 42 U. S. C.
§2000e–2(a)(1), and therefore she can prevail if she can prove that
she was transferred because of her sex.

															I do not join the Court’s unhelpful opinion. For
decades, dozens of lower court judges, with a wealth of experience
handling Title VII cases, have held that not every unwanted
employment experience affects an employee’s “terms” or “conditions”
of employment. The lower courts have used various verbal
formulations to express this point, and the Court, dubious about
the words they had selected, granted review to provide guidance.
Now, after briefing and argument, that guidance is as follows:
Title VII plaintiffs must show that the event they challenge
constituted a “harm” or “injury,” but that the event need not be
“significant” or “substantial.” See ante, at 10–11.

															I have no idea what this means, and I can just
imagine how this guidance will be greeted by lower court judges.
The primary definition of “harm” is “physical or mental damage,”
and an “injury” is defined as “an act that damages, harms, or
hurts: an unjust or undeserved infliction of suffering or harm.”
Webster’s Third International Dictionary 1034, 1164 (1976). These
definitions incorporate at least some degree of significance or
substantiality. We do not typically say that we were harmed or
injured by every unwanted experience. What would we think if a
friend said, “I was harmed because the supermarket had run out of
my favorite brand of peanut butter,” or, “I was injured because I
ran into three rather than the usual two red lights on the way home
from work”?

															I see little if any substantive difference
between the terminology the Court approves and the terminology it
doesn’t like. The predictable result of today’s decision is that
careful lower court judges will mind the words they use but will
continue to do pretty much just what they have done for years.
