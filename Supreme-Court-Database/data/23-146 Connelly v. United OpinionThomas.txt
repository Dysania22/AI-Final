															THOMAS A. CONNELLY, as executor of the ESTATE
OF MICHAEL P. CONNELLY, SR., PETITIONER v. UNITED STATES

															on writ of certiorari to the united states
court of appeals for the eighth circuit

															[June 6, 2024]

															

															Justice Thomas delivered the opinion of the
Court.

															Michael and Thomas Connelly owned a building
supply corporation. The brothers entered into an agreement to
ensure that the company would stay in the family if either brother
died. Under that agreement, the corporation could be required to
redeem (i.e., purchase) the deceased brother’s
shares. To fund the possible share redemption, the corporation
obtained life insurance on each brother. After Michael died, a
narrow dispute arose over how to value his shares for calculating
the estate tax. The central question is whether the corporation’s
obligation to redeem Michael’s shares was a liability that
decreased the value of those shares. We conclude that it was not
and therefore affirm.

															I

															A

															Congress has long imposed a tax “on the
transfer of the taxable estate of every decedent who is a citizen
or resident of the United States.” 26 U. S. C.
§2001(a).[1] A decedent’s
“taxable estate” is the value of “all property, real or personal,
tangible or intangible,” owned by the decedent “at the time of his
death,” minus applicable deductions. §§2031(a), 2051. Imposing the
estate tax thus requires calculating the value of the property in
the decedent’s estate. In general, the lodestar for that assessment
is “fair market value,” which “is the price at which the property
would change hands between a willing buyer and a willing seller,
neither being under any compulsion to buy or to sell and both
having reasonable knowledge of relevant facts.” 26 CFR
§20.2031–1(b) (2021).

															A decedent’s taxable estate includes his shares
in a closely held corporation. 26 U. S. C. §2031(b).
Closely held corporations ordinarily have only a few shareholders
(often within the same family) and, unlike public corporations,
those shareholders typically participate in the corporation’s
day-to-day management. 3 J. Cox & T. Hazen, Law of Corporations
§14.1 (3d ed. 2010) (Cox & Hazen). Given this close working
relationship, shareholders sometimes enter into an agreement to
restrict the transfer of shares to outside investors. 3 id.,
§14.9. One such arrangement involves “giving the corporation or the
other shareholders the right to purchase the shares of a holder on
his death.” Ibid. A related arrangement, called a share
redemption agreement, contractually requires a corporation
to repurchase a deceased shareholder’s shares. Although such an
agreement may delineate how to set a price for the shares, it is
ordinarily not dispositive for valuing the decedent’s shares for
the estate tax. See 26 U. S. C. §2703. As a general rule,
the fair market value of the corporation determines the value of
the shares, and one must therefore consider “the company’s net
worth, prospective earning power and dividend-paying capacity, and
other relevant factors,” “including proceeds of life insurance
policies payable to . . . the company.” 26 CFR
§20.2031–2(f )(2).

															B

															Brothers Michael and Thomas Connelly were the
sole shareholders in Crown C Supply, a small but successful
building supply corporation in St. Louis, Missouri. Michael owned
77.18% of Crown’s outstanding shares (385.9 out of 500 shares), and
Thomas owned the remaining 22.82% (114.1 shares). The brothers
entered into an agreement with Crown to ensure a smooth transition
of ownership and keep Crown in the family in the event one of the
brothers died. The agreement provided that if either Michael or
Thomas died, the surviving brother would have the option to
purchase the deceased brother’s shares. And, if the surviving
brother declined to do so, then Crown itself would be contractually
required to redeem the shares. With an exception not relevant here,
the agreement specified that the redemption price for each share
would be based upon an outside appraisal of Crown’s fair market
value. App. 12–14. To ensure that Crown would have enough money to
redeem the shares if required, Crown obtained $3.5 million in life
insurance on each brother.

															When Michael died in 2013, Thomas opted not to
purchase Michael’s shares. As a result, Crown was obligated under
the agreement to redeem Michael’s shares. Rather than secure an
outside appraisal of the company’s fair market value (as the
agreement contemplated), Michael’s son and Thomas agreed in an
“amicable and expeditious manner” that the value of Michael’s
shares was $3 million. Id., at 25–26. Crown then used $3
million of the life-insurance proceeds to redeem Michael’s shares,
leaving Thomas as Crown’s sole shareholder.

															As the executor of Michael’s estate, Thomas then
filed a federal tax return for the estate. The return reported the
value of Michael’s shares as $3 million, in accordance with the
agreement between Michael’s son and Thomas. The Internal Revenue
Service (IRS) audited the return. During the audit, Thomas obtained
a valuation from an accounting firm. The firm’s analyst took as
given the holding in Estate of Blount v.
Commissioner, 
428 F.3d 1338 (CA11 2005), which concluded that insurance
proceeds should be “deduct[ed] . . . from the value” of a
corporation when they are “offset by an obligation to pay those
proceeds to the estate in a stock buyout.” Id., at 1345. The
analyst thus excluded the $3 million in insurance proceeds used to
redeem Michael’s shares, and determined that Crown’s fair market
value at Michael’s death was $3.86 million. Because Michael held a
77.18% ownership interest, the analyst calculated the value of
Michael’s shares as approximately $3 million ($3.86 million x
0.7718).

															The IRS took a different view, insisting that
Crown’s redemption obligation did not offset the life-insurance
proceeds. The IRS counted the $3 million in life-insurance proceeds
excluded by the analyst and assessed Crown’s total value as $6.86
million ($3.86 million + $3 million). And, the IRS thus calculated
the value of Michael’s shares as $5.3 million ($6.86 million x
0.7718). Based on this higher valuation, the IRS determined that
the estate owed an additional $889,914 in taxes.

															The estate paid the deficiency and Thomas,
acting as executor, sued the United States for a refund. As
relevant, Thomas argued that the $3 million in life-insurance
proceeds used to redeem Michael’s shares should not be counted when
calculating the value of those shares. The District Court granted
summary judgment to the Government, concluding that Michael’s
estate was not entitled to a refund. Connelly v.
Department of Treasury, IRS, 2021 WL 4281288, *17 (ED
Mo., Sept. 21, 2021). The court held that the $3 million in
life-insurance proceeds must be counted to accurately value
Michael’s shares. It explained that, under customary valuation
principles, Crown’s obligation to redeem Michael’s shares was not a
liability that reduced the corporation’s fair market value.
Id., at *14. The court therefore held that Crown’s
redemption obligation did not offset the life-insurance proceeds.
Id., at *15–*17. The Court of Appeals affirmed on the same
basis. Connelly v. Department of Treasury,
IRS, 70 F. 4th 412 (CA8 2023).

															We granted certiorari, 601 U. S. ___
(2023), to address whether life-insurance proceeds that will be
used to redeem a decedent’s shares must be included when
calculating the value of those shares for purposes of the federal
estate tax. We now affirm.

															II

															The dispute in this case is narrow. All agree
that, when calculating the federal estate tax, the value of a
decedent’s shares in a closely held corporation must reflect the
cor- poration’s fair market value. And, all agree that life-
insurance proceeds payable to a corporation are an asset that
increases the corporation’s fair market value. The only question is
whether Crown’s contractual obligation to redeem Michael’s shares
at fair market value offsets the value of life-insurance proceeds
committed to funding that redemption.

															Thomas argues that a contractual obligation to
redeem shares is a liability that offsets the value of
life-insurance proceeds used to fulfill that obligation. Brief for
Petitioner 17. He accordingly contends that anyone purchasing “a
subset of the corporation’s shares would treat the two as canceling
each other out.” Ibid. By contrast, the Government argues
that Crown’s obligation to pay for Michael’s shares did not reduce
the value of those shares. It contends that “no real-world buyer or
seller would have viewed the redemption obligation as an offsetting
liability.” Brief for United States 15. We agree with the
Government.

															An obligation to redeem shares at fair market
value does not offset the value of life-insurance proceeds set
aside for the redemption because a share redemption at fair market
value does not affect any shareholder’s economic interest. A simple
example proves the point. Consider a corporation with one asset—$10
million in cash—and two shareholders, A and B, who own 80 and 20
shares respectively. Each individual share is worth $100,000 ($10
million ÷ 100 shares). So, A’s shares are worth $8 million (80
shares x $100,000) and B’s shares are worth $2 million (20 shares x
$100,000). To redeem B’s shares at fair market value, the
corporation would thus have to pay B $2 million. After the
redemption, A would be the sole shareholder in a corporation worth
$8 million and with 80 outstanding shares. A’s shares would still
be worth $100,000 each ($8 million ÷ 80 shares). Economically, the
redemption would have no impact on either shareholder. The value of
the shareholders’ interests after the redemption—A’s 80 shares and
B’s $2 million in cash—would be equal to the value of their
respective interests in the corporation before the redemption.
Thus, a corporation’s contractual obligation to redeem shares at
fair market value does not reduce the value of those shares in and
of itself.

															Because a fair-market-value redemption has no
effect on any shareholder’s economic interest, no willing buyer
purchasing Michael’s shares would have treated Crown’s obligation
to redeem Michael’s shares at fair market value as a factor that
reduced the value of those shares. At the time of Michael’s death,
Crown was worth $6.86 million—$3 million in life-insurance proceeds
earmarked for the re- demption plus $3.86 million in other assets
and income-generating potential. Anyone purchasing Michael’s shares
would acquire a 77.18% stake in a company worth $6.86 million,
along with Crown’s obligation to redeem those shares at fair market
value. A buyer would therefore pay up to $5.3 million for Michael’s
shares ($6.86 million x 0.7718)—i.e., the value the
buyer could expect to receive in exchange for Michael’s shares when
Crown redeemed them at fair market value. We thus conclude that
Crown’s promise to redeem Michael’s shares at fair market value did
not reduce the value of those shares.

															Thomas resists this straightforward conclusion.
He suggests that Crown’s redemption obligation “would make it
impossible” for a hypothetical buyer seeking to purchase 77.18% of
Crown “to capture the full value of the insurance proceeds.” Brief
for Petitioner 26. That is so, according to Thomas, because the
insurance proceeds would leave the company as soon as they arrived
to complete the redemption. He argues that the “buyer would thus
not consider proceeds that would be used for redemption as net
assets.” Ibid. In other words, Thomas views the relevant
inquiry as what a buyer would pay for shares that make up the same
percentage of the less-valuable corporation that exists after the
redemption. See Estate of Blount v. Commissioner, 87
TCM 1303 (2004), ¶2004–116 RIA Memo TC, aff ’d in part and
rev’d in part, 
428 F.3d 1338 (CA11 2005); see also A. Chodorow, Valuing
Corporations for Estate Tax Purposes, 3 Hastings Bus. L. J. 1,
25 (2006) (“Any valuation that takes the redemption obligation into
account effectively values the corporation on a ‘post-redemption’
basis, i.e., after the decedent’s shares have been redeemed”). But,
for calculating the estate tax, the whole point is to assess how
much Michael’s shares were worth at the time that he died—before
Crown spent $3 million on the redemption payment. See 26
U. S. C. §2033 (defining the gross estate to “include the
value of all property to the extent of the interest therein of the
decedent at the time of his death”); 26 CFR §20.2031–1(b) (the
“value of every item of property includible in a decedent’s gross
estate . . . is its fair market value at the time
of the decedent’s death” (emphasis added)). A hypothetical buyer
would thus treat the life-insurance proceeds that would be used to
redeem Michael’s shares as a net asset.

															Moreover, Thomas’s argument that the redemption
obligation was a liability cannot be reconciled with the basic
mechanics of a stock redemption. As the District Court explained,
when a shareholder redeems his shares he “is essentially ‘cashing
out’ his shares of ownership in the company and its assets.” 2021
WL 4281288, *16. That transaction necessarily reduces a
corporation’s total value. And, because there are fewer outstanding
shares after the redemption, the remaining shareholders are left
with a larger proportional ownership interest in the less-valuable
corporation. Thomas’s understanding, however, would turn this
ordinary process upside down. In Thomas’s view, Crown’s redemption
of Michael’s shares left Thomas with a larger ownership stake in a
company with the same value as before the redemption. Thomas
argues that Crown was worth only $3.86 million before the
redemption, and thus that Michael’s shares were worth approximately
$3 million ($3.86 million x 0.7718). But, he also argues that Crown
was worth $3.86 million after Michael’s shares were
redeemed. See Reply Brief 6. That cannot be right: A corporation
that pays out $3 million to redeem shares should be worth
less than before the redemption. See Cox & Hazen §21.2.
Thomas’s argument thus cannot be reconciled with an elementary
understanding of a stock redemption.

															Finally, Thomas asserts that affirming the
decision below will make succession planning more difficult for
closely held corporations. He reasons that if life-insurance
proceeds earmarked for a share redemption are a net asset for
estate-tax purposes, then “Crown would have needed an insurance
policy worth far more than $3 million in order to redeem Michael’s
shares at fair market value.” Brief for Petitioner 33. True enough,
but that is simply a consequence of how the Connelly brothers chose
to structure their agreement. There were other options. For
example, the brothers could have used a cross-purchase agreement—an
arrangement in which shareholders agree to purchase each other’s
shares at death and purchase life-insurance policies on each other
to fund the agreement. See S. Pratt, Valuing a Business 821 (6th
ed. 2022). A cross-purchase agreement would have allowed Thomas to
purchase Michael’s shares and keep Crown in the family, while
avoiding the risk that the insurance proceeds would increase the
value of Michael’s shares. The proceeds would have gone directly to
Thomas—not to Crown. But, every arrangement has its own drawbacks.
A cross-purchase agreement would have required each brother to pay
the premiums for the insurance policy on the other brother,
creating a risk that one of them would be unable to do so. And, it
would have had its own tax consequences. By opting to have Crown
purchase the life-insurance policies and pay the premiums, the
Connelly brothers guaranteed that the policies would remain in
force and that the insurance proceeds would be available to fund
the redemption. As we have explained, however, this arrangement
also meant that Crown would receive the proceeds and thereby
increase the value of Michael’s shares. Thomas’ concerns about the
implications of how he and Michael structured their agreement are
therefore misplaced.

															III

															We hold that Crown’s contractual obligation to
redeem Michael’s shares did not diminish the value of those
shares.[2] Because redemption
obligations are not necessarily liabilities that reduce a
corporation’s value for purposes of the federal estate tax, we
affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.

															It is so ordered.

Notes
1
 Not all estates are
subject to the estate tax. Because certain credits are allowed
against the estate tax, any estate valued below a certain threshold
(today, about $13.6 million) is not subject to the tax. See 26
U. S. C. §2010(c).
2
 We do not hold that a
redemption obligation can never decrease a corporation’s
value. A redemption obligation could, for instance, require a
corporation to liquidate operating assets to pay for the shares,
thereby decreasing its future earning capacity. We simply reject
Thomas’s position that all redemption obligations reduce a
corporation’s net value. Because that is all this case requires, we
decide no more.
