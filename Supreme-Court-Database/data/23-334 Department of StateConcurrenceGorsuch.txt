															SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

															_________________

															No. 23–334

															_________________

															Department of State, et al., PETITIONERS
v. Sandra MuÑoz, et al.

															on writ of certiorari to the united states
court of appeals for the ninth circuit

															[June 21, 2024]

															Justice Gorsuch, concurring in the
judgment.

															A consular officer denied Sandra Muñoz’s husband
a visa to come to and live lawfully in the United States. 526
F. Supp. 3d 709, 713–714 (CD Cal. 2021). In doing so, the
officer simply cited 8 U. S. C. §1182(a)(3)(A)(ii), a
provision of the Immigration and Nationality Act that makes
inadmissible any person a consular officer “has reasonable ground
to believe . . . seeks to enter the United States to
engage . . . in . . . any other unlawful
activity.” Eventually, Ms. Muñoz sued for further explanation of
that decision. See App. 2, 8–9. The government, she claimed, needed
to identify for her not just the statute on which it based its
decision, but also the “ ‘discrete factual predicates’ ”
on which it relied. Id., at 8, ¶36.

															Over the course of this litigation, the United
States has given Ms. Muñoz what she requested. As the Ninth Circuit
recognized, the United States has now revealed the factual basis
for its decision to deny her husband a visa. 50 F. 4th 906, 919–920
(2022); see App. to Pet. for Cert. 124a; App. 76. In this Court,
too, the government has assured Ms. Muñoz that she has a chance to
use and respond to that information. She can again seek her
husband’s admission to this country, the government says—and this
time she will be armed with an understanding of why the government
denied the last application. Tr. of Oral Arg. 45, 104.

															Those developments should end this case. With no
more information to uncover and no bar to trying for admission
again, nothing is left for a court to address through this
litigation. In particular, the constitutional questions presented
by the government no longer have any practical relevance here.
Whether or not Ms. Muñoz had a constitutional right to the
information she wanted, the government gave it to her. I therefore
would reverse the Ninth Circuit’s decision without reaching the
government’s constitutional arguments. See City of Mesquite
v. Aladdin’s Castle, Inc., 455 U.S.
283, 294–295 (1982). At the same time, I do not cast aspersions
on the motives of my colleagues who do reach the government’s
arguments. They may see the case differently than I do, but their
decision and rationales are essentially those the Solicitor General
and the Department of State urged this Court to adopt.
