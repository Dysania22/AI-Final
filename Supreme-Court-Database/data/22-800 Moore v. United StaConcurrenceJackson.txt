															SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

															CHARLES G. MOORE, et ux., PETITIONERS
v. UNITED STATES

															on writ of certiorari to the united states
court of appeals for the ninth circuit

															[June 20, 2024]

															

															Justice Jackson, concurring.

															Our Constitution grants Congress “plenary power”
over taxation. Brushaber v. Union Pacific R. Co.,
240 U.S.
1, 13 (1916). The text supplies only two relevant conditions:
Direct taxes must be apportioned among the States based on
population, see Art. I, §9; all other taxes must “be uniform
throughout the United States,” §8. During the century after our
Nation’s founding, the Court repeatedly recognized that, in matters
of tax policy, Congress’s view was controlling. See,
e.g., Pacific Ins. Co. v. Soule, 7
Wall. 433, 443 (1869) (“Where the power of taxation, exercised by
Congress, is warranted by the Constitution . . . it is,
necessarily, unlimited in its nature”); Collector v.
Hubbard, 12 Wall. 1, 18 (1871) (upholding a tax on
undistributed corporate earnings because “it is as competent for
Congress to tax annual gains and profits before they are divided
among the holders of the stock as afterwards”).

															Then came Pollock v. Farmers’ Loan
& Trust Co., 158 U.S.
601 (1895). In that case, the Court invalidated a federal
income tax, holding that a tax on income derived from property was
a direct tax requiring apportionment. See id., at 637.
Pollock provoked immediate outcry. President Taft, later
Chief Justice of this Court, said, “ ‘Nothing has ever injured
the prestige of the Supreme Court more.’ ” B. Ackerman,
Taxation and the Constitution, 99 Colum. L. Rev. 1, 5 (1999).
In 1913, the People’s representatives responded, using their power
to overturn Pollock via constitutional amendment. The
Sixteenth Amendment restored to Congress the power to tax “incomes,
from whatever source derived, without apportionment.”

															Against that stark backdrop, the Court wisely
takes a restrained approach today. Petitioners allege that the
Mandatory Repatriation Tax (MRT) exceeded Congress’s power by
taxing shareholders on the undistributed income of a corporation;
such a tax, petitioners argue, is really a direct tax requiring
apportionment. The majority opinion rightly rejects that challenge,
thoroughly explaining why the MRT falls within Congress’s
long-recognized, oft-exercised power to tax shareholders on the
undistributed income of a business entity. See ante, at 22.
I write separately to emphasize that, before taking up petitioners’
invitation to strike down a lawfully enacted tax, the Court would
need to be persuaded of several additional arguments that we wisely
do not reach. I highlight two.

															First, we would need to agree with petitioners
that Congress can tax income only if it is actually received or
“realized.” That alleged requirement appears nowhere in the text of
the Sixteenth Amendment. See Brief for John R. Brooks et al. as
Amici Curiae 14–21 (explaining that the phrase “from
whatever source derived” served only to overrule Pollock).
Moreover, both before and after the Sixteenth Amendment was
adopted, the term “income” was widely recognized as flexible enough
to include both realized and unrealized gains. See Brief for United
States 14–26 (collecting sources); Brief for Professors of Tax Law
et al. as Amici Curiae 6–20 (same).

															The alleged realization requirement is, instead,
drawn from a decision of this Court, Eisner v.
Macomber, 252 U.S.
189 (1920). Macomber struck down a tax on stock
dividends, ostensibly because the taxpayer “ha[d] not realized or
received any income in the transaction.” Id., at 212. Like
Pollock, Macomber was “promptly and sharply
criticised.” Helvering v. Griffiths, 318 U.S.
371, 373 (1943). Over the two decades that followed our
pronouncement, we “limited” Macomber’s realization
requirement “to the kind of dividend there dealt with,” 318
U. S., at 375, while also “undermin[ing] . . . the
original theoretical bases of the decision in” other contexts,
id., at 394.

															Thus, there is no constitutional requirement,
from Macomber or otherwise, that a taxpayer “be able to
sever . . . the gain from his original capital” in order
to be taxed on it. Helvering v. Bruun, 309 U.S.
461, 469 (1940); see also Cottage Savings Assn. v.
Commissioner, 499 U.S.
554, 559 (1991) (explaining that, properly understood, “the
concept of realization is ‘founded on administrative
convenience,’ ” compared to the “ ‘cumbersome’ ”
process of “valuing assets on an annual basis to determine . . .
appreciat[ion]”). In the lower courts too, Macomber’s
definition of income has long been deemed outmoded, if not
overruled.[1] Any litigant
seeking to sustain her case on the basis of Macomber would
have to bring back from the dead its Court-created limit on
Congress’s power.[2]

															Second, even if we were to hold that a uniform
tax violated the Sixteenth Amendment, we would still need to
confirm that the tax was a direct tax before requiring
apportionment. The Constitution does not exhaustively define direct
taxes, though it appears the category was originally intended to
encompass only land and head taxes. See, e.g.,
Hylton v. United States, 3 Dall. 171, 175 (1796)
(opinion of Chase, J.); id., at 177 (opinion of Paterson,
J.); id. at 183 (opinion of Iredell, J.). But the
Constitution does expressly exclude certain taxes—“Duties, Imposts
and Excises”—from apportionment, and we have long interpreted those
categories of taxes broadly. Art. I, §8; see also Steward
Machine Co. v. Davis, 301 U.S.
548, 581–582 (1937). Indeed, we have upheld uniform taxes as
excises, even when predicated on something that, if taxed on its
own, might require apportionment or even be nontaxable. See
Flint v. Stone Tracy Co., 220
U.S. 107, 150–152, 165 (1911). In this case, the Government
argues that the MRT can be understood as an excise tax on the
privilege of doing business through a controlled foreign
corporation. See Brief for United States 46–49. That argument, too,
would need to be considered before we could strike down a uniform
tax like the MRT.

															*  *  *

															I have no doubt that future Congresses will
pass, and future Presidents will sign, taxes that outrage one group
or another—taxes that strike some as demanding too much, others as
asking too little. There may even be impositions that, as a matter
of policy, all can agree are wrongheaded. However, Pollock
teaches us that this Court’s role in such disputes should be
limited. “[T]he remedy for such abuses is to be found at the
ballot-box, and in a wholesome public opinion which the
representatives of the people will not long, if at all, disregard,
and not in the disregard by the judiciary of powers that have been
committed to another branch of the government.” Pollock, 158
U. S., at 680 (Harlan, J., dissenting).

															With that understanding, I join the Court’s
opinion in full.

Notes
1
See, e.g.,
Commissioner v. Obear-Nester Glass Co., 217 F.2d 56,
60 (CA7 1954) (“Even as to income derived from capital
[Macomber] has been limited to its specific facts”);
United States v. James, 333 F.2d 748, 752 (CA9 1964)
(“[I]nsofar as [Macomber] purported to offer a comprehensive
definition of the term income as used in the Sixteenth Amendment,
it has been discarded”); Prescott v. Commissioner,
561 F.2d 1287, 1293 (CA8 1977) (“[T]he Supreme Court has found it
necessary to abandon [Macomber’s] attempt at an
all-inclusive definition of income”).

To be sure, Macomber is
a hard decision to parse, and it might be read to allow taxation of
an asset only if the owner receives some new, increased value. See
Eisner v. Macomber, 252 U.S.
189, 211 (1920) (emphasizing that a stock dividend does not
necessarily “increase the intrinsic value of [the taxpayer’s]
holding”); see also Koshland v. Helvering, 298 U.S.
441, 445–446 (1936). If that reading is correct,
Macomber would not preclude taxation of unrealized gains.
