															KEN PAXTON, ATTORNEY GENERAL OF
TEXAS

															on writ of certiorari to the united states
court of appeals for the fifth circuit

															[July 1, 2024]

															Justice Jackson, concurring in part and
concurring in the judgment.

															These cases present a complex clash between two
novel state laws and the alleged First Amendment rights of several
of the largest social media platforms. Some things are already
clear. Not every potential action taken by a social media company
will qualify as expression protected under the First Amendment. But
not every hypothesized regulation of such a company’s operations
will necessarily be able to withstand the force of the First
Amendment’s protections either. Beyond those broadest of
statements, it is difficult to say much more at this time. With
these records and lower court decisions, we are not able to
adequately evaluate whether the challenged state laws are facially
valid.

															That is in no small part because, as all Members
of the Court acknowledge, plaintiffs bringing a facial challenge
must clear a high bar. See ante, at 9–10 (majority opinion);
post, at 13–14 (Alito, J., concurring in judgment). The
Eleventh Circuit failed to appreciate the nature of this challenge,
and the Fifth Circuit did not adequately evaluate it. That said, I
agree with Justice Barrett that the Eleventh Circuit at least
fairly stated our First Amendment precedent, whereas the Fifth
Circuit did not. See ante, at 1 (concurring opinion); see
also ante, at 13–19 (majority opinion). On remand, then,
both courts will have to undertake their legal analyses anew.

															In doing so, the lower courts must address these
cases at the right level of specificity. The question is not
whether an entire category of corporations (like social media
companies) or a particular entity (like Facebook) is generally
engaged in expression. Nor is it enough to say that a given
activity (say, content moderation) for a particular service (the
News Feed, for example) seems roughly analogous to a more familiar
example from our precedent. Cf. Red Lion Broadcasting Co. v.
FCC, 395 U.S.
367, 386 (1969) (positing that “differences in the
characteristics of new media justify differences in the First
Amendment standards applied to them”). Even when evaluating a broad
facial challenge, courts must make sure they carefully parse not
only what entities are regulated, but how the regulated activities
actually function before deciding if the activity in
question constitutes expression and therefore comes within the
First Amendment’s ambit. See Brief for Knight First Amendment
Institute at Columbia University as Amicus Curiae 11–12.
Thus, further factual development may be necessary before either of
today’s challenges can be fully and fairly addressed.

															In light of the high bar for facial challenges
and the state of these cases as they come to us, I would not go on
to treat either like an as-applied challenge and preview our
potential ruling on the merits. Faced with difficult constitutional
issues arising in new contexts on undeveloped records, this Court
should strive to avoid deciding more than is necessary. See
Ashwander v. TVA, 297 U.S.
288, 346–347 (1936) (Brandeis, J., concurring). In my view,
such restraint is warranted today.
