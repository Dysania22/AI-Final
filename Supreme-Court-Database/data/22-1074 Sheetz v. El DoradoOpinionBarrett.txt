															GEORGE SHEETZ, PETITIONER v. COUNTY OF
EL DORADO, CALIFORNIA

															on writ of certiorari to the court of appeal
of california, third appellate district

															[April 12, 2024]

															

															Justice Barrett delivered the opinion of the
Court.

															George Sheetz wanted to build a small,
prefabricated home on his residential parcel of land. To obtain a
permit, though, he had to pay a substantial fee to mitigate local
traffic congestion. Relying on this Court’s decisions in
Nollan v. California Coastal Comm’n, 483 U.S.
825 (1987), and Dolan v. City of Tigard,
512 U.S.
374 (1994), Sheetz challenged the fee as an unlawful “exaction”
of money under the Takings Clause. The California Court of Appeal
rejected that argument because the traffic impact fee was imposed
by legislation, and, according to the court, Nollan and
Dolan apply only to permit conditions imposed on an
ad hoc basis by administrators. That is incorrect. The Takings
Clause does not distinguish between legislative and administrative
permit conditions.

															I

															A

															El Dorado County, California is a rural
jurisdiction that lies east of Sacramento and extends to the Nevada
border. Much of the County’s 1,700 square miles is backcountry. It
is home to the Sierra Nevada mountain range and the Eldorado
National Forest. Those areas, composed mainly of public lands, are
sparsely populated. Visitors from around the world use the natural
areas for fishing, backpacking, and other recreational
activities.

															Most of the County’s residents are concentrated
in the west and east regions. In the west, the towns of El Dorado
Hills, Cameron Park, and Shingle Springs form the outer reaches of
Sacramento’s suburbs. Placerville, the county seat, lies just
beyond them. In the east, residents live along the south shores of
Lake Tahoe. Highway 50 connects these population centers and
divides the County into north and south portions.

															In recent decades, the County has experienced
significant population growth, and with it an increase in new
development. To account for the new demand on public services, the
County’s Board of Supervisors adopted a planning document, which it
calls the General Plan, to address issues ranging from wastewater
collection to land-use restrictions.[1] The Board of Supervisors is a legislative body under
state law, and the adoption of its General Plan is a legislative
act. See Cal. Govt. Code Ann. §65300 et seq. (West
2024).

															To address traffic congestion, the General Plan
requires developers to pay a traffic impact fee as a condition of
receiving a building permit. The County uses proceeds from these
fees to fund improvements to its road system. The fee amount is
determined by a rate schedule, which takes into account the type of
development (commercial, residential, and so on) and its location
within the County. The amount is not based on “the cost
specifically attributable to the particular project on which the
fee is imposed.” 84 Cal. App. 5th 394, 402, 300 Cal. Rptr. 3d 308,
312 (2022).

															B

															George Sheetz owns property in the center of
the County near Highway 50, which the General Plan classifies as
“Low Density Residential.” [2] Sheetz and his wife applied for a permit to build a
modest prefabricated house on the parcel, with plans to raise their
grandson there. As a condition of receiving the permit, the County
required Sheetz to pay a traffic impact fee of $23,420, as dictated
by the General Plan’s rate schedule. Sheetz paid the fee under
protest and obtained the permit. The County did not respond to his
request for a refund.

															Sheetz sought relief in state court. He claimed,
among other things, that conditioning the building permit on the
payment of a traffic impact fee constituted an unlawful “exaction”
of money in violation of the Takings Clause. In Sheetz’s view, our
decisions in Nollan v. California Coastal Comm’n,
483 U.S.
825, and Dolan v. City of Tigard, 512 U.S.
374, required the County to make an individualized
determination that the fee amount was necessary to offset traffic
congestion attributable to his specific development. The County’s
predetermined fee schedule, Sheetz argued, failed to meet that
requirement.

															The trial court rejected Sheetz’s claim and the
California Court of Appeal affirmed. Relying on precedent from the
California Supreme Court, the Court of Appeal asserted that the
Nollan/Dolan test applies only to permit conditions
imposed “ ‘on an individual and discretionary basis.’ ”
84 Cal. App. 5th, at 406, 300 Cal. Rptr. 3d, at 316 (quoting San
Remo Hotel L. P. v. City and Cty. of San Francisco,

27 Cal. 4th 643, 666–670, 
41 P.3d 87, 102–105 (2002)). Fees imposed on “a broad class of
property owners through legislative action,” it said, need not
satisfy that test. 84 Cal. App. 5th, at 407, 300 Cal. Rptr. 3d, at
316. The California Supreme Court denied review.

															State courts have reached different conclusions
on the question whether the Takings Clause recognizes a distinction
between legislative and administrative conditions on land-use
permits.[3] We granted
certiorari to resolve the split. 600 U. S. ___ (2023).

															II

															A

															When the government wants to take private
property to build roads, courthouses, or other public projects, it
must compensate the owner at fair market value. The just
compensation requirement comes from the Fifth Amendment’s Takings
Clause, which provides: “nor shall private property be taken for
public use, without just compensation.” By requiring the government
to pay for what it takes, the Takings Clause saves individual
property owners from bearing “public burdens which, in all fairness
and justice, should be borne by the public as a whole.”
Armstrong v. United States, 364 U.S.
40, 49 (1960).

															The Takings Clause’s right to just compensation
coexists with the States’ police power to engage in land-use
planning. (Though at times the two seem more like in-laws than
soulmates.) While States have substantial authority to regulate
land use, see Village of Euclid v. Amber Realty Co.,
272 U.S.
365 (1926), the right to compensation is triggered if they
“physically appropriat[e]” property or otherwise interfere with the
owner’s right to exclude others from it, Cedar Point Nursery
v. Hassid, 594 U.S. 139, 149–152 (2021). That sort of
intrusion on property rights is a per se taking.
Loretto v. Teleprompter Manhattan CATV Corp.,
458 U.S.
419, 426 (1982). Different rules apply to State laws that
merely restrict how land is used. A use restriction that is
“reasonably necessary to the effectuation of a substantial
government purpose” is not a taking unless it saps too much of the
property’s value or frustrates the owner’s investment-backed
expectations. Penn Central Transp. Co. v. New York
City, 438 U.S.
104, 123, 127 (1978); see also Lucas v. South
Carolina Coastal Council, 505 U.S.
1003, 1016 (1992) (“[T]he Fifth Amendment is violated when
land-use regulation does not substantially advance legitimate state
interests or denies an owner economically viable use of his
land” (internal quotation marks omitted)).

															Permit conditions are more complicated. If the
government can deny a building permit to further a “legitimate
police-power purpose,” then it can also place conditions on the
permit that serve the same end. Nollan, 483 U. S., at
836. Such conditions do not entitle the landowner to compensation
even if they require her to convey a portion of her property to the
government. Ibid. Thus, if a proposed development will
“substantially increase traffic congestion,” the government may
condition the building permit on the owner’s willingness “to deed
over the land needed to widen a public road.” Koontz v.
St. Johns River Water Management Dist., 570 U.S.
595, 605 (2013). We have described permit conditions of this
nature as “a hallmark of responsible land-use policy.” Ibid.
The government is entitled to put the landowner to the choice of
accepting the bargain or abandoning the proposed development. See
R. Epstein, Bargaining With the State 188 (1993).

															The bargain takes on a different character when
the government withholds or conditions a building permit for
reasons unrelated to its land-use interests. Imagine that a local
planning commission denies the owner of a vacant lot a building
permit unless she allows the commission to host its annual holiday
party in her backyard (in propertyspeak, granting it a
limited-access easement). The landowner is “likely to accede to the
government’s demand, no matter how unreasonable,” so long as she
values the building permit more. Koontz, 570 U. S., at
605. So too if the commission gives the landowner the option of
bankrolling the party at a local pub instead of hosting it on her
land. See id., at 612–615. Because such conditions lack a
sufficient connection to a legitimate land-use interest, they
amount to “an out-and-out plan of extortion.” Nollan, 483
U. S., at 837 (internal quotation marks omitted).

															Our decisions in Nollan and Dolan
address this potential abuse of the permitting process. There, we
set out a two-part test modeled on the unconstitutional conditions
doctrine. See Perry v. Sindermann, 408 U.S.
593, 597 (1972) (government “may not deny a benefit to a person
on a basis that infringes his constitutionally protected
interests”). First, permit conditions must have an “essential
nexus” to the government’s land-use interest. Nollan, 483
U. S., at 837. The nexus requirement ensures that the
government is acting to further its stated purpose, not leveraging
its permitting monopoly to exact private property without paying
for it. See id., at 841. Second, permit conditions must have
“ ‘rough proportionality’ ” to the development’s impact
on the land-use interest. Dolan, 512 U. S., at 391. A
permit condition that requires a landowner to give up more than is
necessary to mitigate harms resulting from new development has the
same potential for abuse as a condition that is unrelated to that
purpose. See id., at 393. This test applies regardless of
whether the condition requires the landowner to relinquish property
or requires her to pay a “monetary exactio[n]” instead of
relinquishing the property. Koontz, 570 U. S., at
612–615.

															B

															The California Court of Appeal declined to
assess the County’s traffic impact fee for an essential nexus and
rough proportionality based on its view that the
Nollan/Dolan test does not apply to “legislatively
prescribed monetary fees.” 84 Cal. App. 5th, at 407, 300 Cal. Rptr.
3d, at 316 (internal quotation marks omitted). That was error.
Nothing in constitutional text, history, or precedent supports
exempting legislatures from ordinary takings rules.

															The Constitution’s text does not limit the
Takings Clause to a particular branch of government. The Clause
itself, which speaks in the passive voice, “focuses on (and
prohibits) a certain ‘act’: the taking of private property without
just compensation.” Knight v. Metropolitan Govt. of
Nashville & Davidson Cty., 67 F. 4th 816, 829 (CA6 2023).
It does not single out legislative acts for special treatment. Nor
does the Fourteenth Amendment, which incorporates the Takings
Clause against the States. On the contrary, the Amendment
constrains the power of each “State” as an undivided whole. §1.
Thus, there is “no textual justification for saying that the
existence or the scope of a State’s power to expropriate private
property without just compensation varies according to the branch
of government effecting the expropriation.” Stop the Beach
Renourishment, Inc. v. Florida Dept. of Environmental
Protection, 560 U.S.
702, 714 (2010) (plurality opinion). Just as the Takings Clause
“protects ‘private property’ without any distinction between
different types,” Horne v. Department of Agriculture,
576 U.S.
351, 358 (2015), it constrains the government without any
distinction between legislation and other official acts. So far as
the Constitution’s text is concerned, permit conditions imposed by
the legislature and other branches stand on equal footing.

															The same goes for history. In fact, special
deference for legislative takings would have made little sense
historically, because legislation was the conventional way that
governments exercised their eminent domain power. Before the
founding, colonial governments passed statutes to secure land for
courthouses, prisons, and other public buildings. See,
e.g., 4 Statutes at Large of South Carolina 319 (T.
Cooper ed. 1838) (Act of 1770) (Cooper); 6 Statutes at Large, Laws
of Virginia 283 (W. Hening ed. 1819) (Act of 1752) (Hening). These
statutes “invariably required the award of compensation to the
owners when land was taken.” J. Ely, “That Due Satisfaction May Be
Made:” the Fifth Amendment and the Origins of the Compensation
Principle, 36 Am. J. Legal Hist. 1, 5 (1992). Colonial practice
thus echoed English law, which vested Parliament alone with the
eminent domain power and required that property owners receive
“full indemnification . . . for a reasonable price.” 1 W.
Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England 139 (1768).

															During and after the Revolution, governments
continued to exercise their eminent domain power through
legislation. States passed statutes to obtain private land for
their new capitals and provided compensation to the landowners.
See, e.g., 4 Cooper 751–752 (Act of 1786); 10 Hening
85–87 (1822 ed.) (Act of 1779). At the national level, Congress
passed legislation to settle the Northwest Territory, which
likewise required the payment of compensation to dispossessed
property owners. Northwest Ordinance of 1789, 1Stat. 52. Two years
later, the Fifth Amendment enshrined this longstanding practice.
Against this background, it is little surprise that early
constitutional theorists understood the Takings Clause to bind the
legislature specifically. See, e.g., 3 J. Story,
Commentaries on the Constitution of the United States §1784, p. 661
(1833); 2 J. Kent, Commentaries on American Law 275–276 (1827). Far
from supporting a deferential view, history shows that legislation
was a prime target for scrutiny under the Takings Clause.

															Precedent points the same way as text and
history. A legislative exception to the Nollan/Dolan
test “conflicts with the rest of our takings jurisprudence,” which
does not otherwise distinguish between legislation and other
official acts. Knick v. Township of Scott, 588 U.S.
180, 185 (2019). That is true of physical takings, regulatory
takings, and the unconstitutional conditions doctrine in which the
Nollan/Dolan test is rooted.

															Start with our physical takings cases. We have
applied the per se rule requiring just compensation to
both legislation and administrative action. In Loretto, we
held that a state statute effected a taking because it authorized
cable companies to install equipment on private property without
the owner’s consent. 458 U. S., at 438. In Horne, we
held that an administrative order effected a taking because it
required farmers to give the Federal Government a portion of their
crop to stabilize market prices. 576 U. S., at 361. The branch
of government that authorized the appropriation did not matter to
the analysis in either case. Nor should it have. As we have
explained: “The essential question is not . . . whether
the government action at issue comes garbed as a regulation (or
statute, or ordinance, or miscellaneous decree). It is whether the
government has physically taken property for itself or someone
else.” Cedar Point, 594 U. S., at 149.

															This principle is evident in our regulatory
takings cases too. We have examined land-use restrictions imposed
by both legislatures and administrative agencies to determine
whether the restriction amounted to a taking. In Pennsylvania
Coal Co. v. Mahon, we held a state statute effected a
taking because it prohibited the owner of mineral rights from
mining coal beneath the surface estate, thus depriving the mineral
rights of practically all economic value. 260
U.S. 393, 414 (1922). And in Palazzolo v. Rhode
Island, we remanded for the lower courts to determine whether
an agency decision effected a taking when it denied the owner
permission to build a beach club on the wetland portion of his
property but allowed him to build a home on the upland portion.
533 U.S.
606, 631 (2001). Here again, our decisions did not suggest that
the outcome turned on which branch of government imposed the
restrictions.

															Excusing legislation from the
Nollan/Dolan test would also conflict with precedent
applying the unconstitutional conditions doctrine in other
contexts. We have applied that doctrine to scrutinize legislation
that placed conditions on the right to free speech, Agency for
Int’l Development v. Alliance for Open Society Int’l,
Inc., 570 U.S.
205 (2013), free exercise of religion, Sherbert v.
Verner, 374 U.S.
398 (1963), and access to federal courts, Terral v.
Burke Constr. Co., 257 U.S.
529 (1922), among others, e.g., Memorial
Hospital v. Maricopa County, 415
U.S. 250 (1974) (right to travel). Failing to give like
treatment to legislative conditions on building permits would thus
“relegat[e the just compensation requirement] to the status of a
poor relation” to other constitutional rights. Dolan, 512
U. S., at 392.

															In sum, there is no basis for affording property
rights less protection in the hands of legislators than
administrators. The Takings Clause applies equally to both—which
means that it prohibits legislatures and agencies alike from
imposing unconstitutional conditions on land-use permits.

															III

															The County no longer contends otherwise. In
fact, at oral argument, the parties expressed “radical agreement”
that conditions on building permits are not exempt from scrutiny
under Nollan and Dolan just because a legislature
imposed them. Tr. of Oral Arg. 4, 73–74. The County was wise to
distance itself from the rule applied by the California Court of
Appeal, because, as we have explained, a legislative exception to
the ordinary takings rules finds no support in constitutional text,
history, or precedent.

															We do not address the parties’ other disputes
over the validity of the traffic impact fee, including whether a
permit condition imposed on a class of properties must be tailored
with the same degree of specificity as a permit condition that
targets a particular development. The California Court of Appeal
did not consider this point—or any of the parties’ other nuanced
arguments—because it proceeded from the erroneous premise that
legislative permit conditions are categorically exempt from the
requirements of Nollan and Dolan. Whether the
parties’ other arguments are preserved and how they bear on
Sheetz’s legal challenge are for the state courts to consider in
the first instance.

															*  *  *

															The judgment of the California Court of Appeal
is vacated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings not
inconsistent with this opinion.

															It is so ordered.
