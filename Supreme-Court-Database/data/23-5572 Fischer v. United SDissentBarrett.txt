															SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

															JOSEPH W. FISCHER, PETITIONER v. UNITED
STATES

															on writ of certiorari to the united states
court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit

															[June 28, 2024]

															

															Justice Barrett, with whom Justice Sotomayor
and Justice Kagan join, dissenting.

															Joseph Fischer allegedly joined a mob of rioters
that breached the Capitol on January 6, 2021. At the time, Congress
was meeting in a joint session to certify the Electoral College
results. The riot forced Congress to suspend the proceeding,
delaying it for several hours.

															The Court does not dispute that Congress’s joint
session qualifies as an “official proceeding”; that rioters delayed
the proceeding; or even that Fischer’s alleged conduct (which
includes trespassing and a physical confrontation with law
enforcement) was part of a successful effort to forcibly halt the
certification of the election results. Given these premises, the
case that Fischer can be tried for “obstructing, influencing, or
impeding an official proceeding” seems open and shut. So why does
the Court hold otherwise?

															Because it simply cannot believe that Congress
meant what it said. Section 1512(c)(2) is a very broad provision,
and admittedly, events like January 6th were not its target. (Who
could blame Congress for that failure of imagination?) But statutes
often go further than the problem that inspired them, and under the
rules of statutory interpretation, we stick to the text anyway. The
Court, abandoning that approach, does textual backflips to find
some way—any way—to narrow the reach of subsection (c)(2). I
respectfully dissent.

															I

															The case for the Government’s interpretation
is straightforward. It can be accomplished in three paragraphs, as
compared to the Court’s many, many more. Ante, at 4–12.

															Start with the verbs: To “obstruct” and to
“impede” mean to “hinder” or “retard” something’s “passage” or
“progress.” 10 Oxford English Dictionary 668 (2d ed. 1989); 7
id., at 705. We have previously explained that these words
are “broad.” Marinello v. United States, 584 U.S. 1,
7 (2018). To “influence” is similarly expansive, meaning “[t]o
affect the condition of ” or “to have an effect on” something.
7 Oxford English Dictionary, at 940. The object of these verbs is
an “official proceeding,” defined to include “a proceeding before
the Congress.” 18 U. S. C. §1515(a)(1)(B).[1] So (c)(2) covers all sorts of actions that
affect or interfere with official proceedings.

															“[O]therwise,” which introduces 18
U. S. C. §1512(c)(2), does not narrow its scope.
“Otherwise” means “in a different manner,” “by other means,” or “in
other respects.” 10 Oxford English Dictionary, at 984; Webster’s
Third New International Dictionary 1598 (2002). It is often used to
introduce a “catchall phras[e].” Texas Dept. of Housing and
Community Affairs v. Inclusive Communities Project,
576 U.S.
519, 535 (2015). Here, “otherwise” tells the reader how (c)(1)
and (c)(2) fit together. Subsection (c)(1) prohibits “alter[ing],
destroy[ing], mutilat[ing], or conceal[ing] a record, document, or
other object” with “intent to impair [its] integrity or
availability for use in an official proceeding.” In other words,
(c)(1) targets document and object spoliation—classic means of
obstruction. Subsection (c)(2) then prohibits obstructing,
influencing, or impeding an official proceeding by means
different from those specified in (c)(1), thereby serving as
a catchall. The “enumerated” crimes in (c)(1) and the “unenumerated
crimes” in (c)(2) are similar “on one specific dimension”: “the
particular similarity specified after the
‘otherwise.’ ” Begay v. United States, 553 U.S.
137, 150–151 (2008) (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment). Here,
that means that each crime represents one means through which to
obstruct, influence, or impede an official proceeding.

															Joseph Fischer allegedly participated in a riot
at the Capitol that forced the delay of Congress’s joint session on
January 6th. Blocking an official proceeding from moving forward
surely qualifies as obstructing or impeding the proceeding by means
other than document destruction. Fischer’s alleged conduct
thus falls within (c)(2)’s scope.

															II

															A

															Opting for a narrower approach, the Court
declines to take (c)(2) on its own terms. Instead, it borrows the
evidentiary focus of (c)(1) to hold that a defendant violates
(c)(2) only by “impair[ing] the availability or integrity for use
in an official proceeding of records, documents, objects, or
. . . other things used in the proceeding.”
Ante, at 16. Other means of obstructing a proceeding—say, by
shutting it down—are out.

															This interpretation might sound faithful to the
statute, because the limit comes from a related provision rather
than thin air. But snipping words from one subsection and grafting
them onto another violates our normal interpretive principles.
“ ‘[W]e ordinarily resist reading words or elements into a
statute that do not appear on its face.’ ” Dean v.
United States, 556 U.S.
568, 572 (2009) (quoting Bates v. United States,
522 U.S.
23, 29 (1997)). And “ ‘[w]here Congress includes
particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in
another section of the same Act,’ ” we generally presume that
Congress did so intentionally. Russello v. United
States, 464 U.S.
16, 23 (1983) (quoting United States v. Wong Kim
Bo, 472 F.2d 720, 722 (CA5 1972) (per curiam)). The
Court’s reasons for departing from these rules are thin.

															1

															The Court begins with the noscitur a
sociis and ejusdem generis canons. Ante, at 5.
The noscitur canon counsels that “words grouped in a list
should be given related meanings.” A. Scalia & B. Garner,
Reading Law §31, p. 195 (2012) (internal quotation marks omitted).
It is particularly useful when interpreting “ ‘a word [that]
is capable of many meanings.’ ” McDonnell v. United
States, 579 U.S. 550, 569 (2016) (quoting Jarecki v.
G. D. Searle & Co., 367 U.S.
303, 307 (1961)). See, e.g., Gustafson v.
Alloyd Co., 513 U.S.
561, 573–575 (1995) (employing the canon to interpret
“communication” in the statutory list “ ‘prospectus, notice,
circular, advertisement, letter, or communication’ ”). The
ejusdem canon applies when “a catchall phrase” follows “an
enumeration of specifics, as in dogs, cats,
horses, cattle, and other animals.” Scalia
& Garner §32, at 199. We often interpret the catchall phrase to
“embrace only objects similar in nature to those objects enumerated
by the preceding specific words.” Circuit City Stores, Inc.
v. Adams, 532 U.S.
105, 115 (2001). See, e.g., Washington State
Dept. of Social and Health Servs. v. Guardianship Estate of
Keffeler, 537 U.S.
371, 375, 385 (2003) (employing the canon to construe the
general term in the statutory list “ ‘execution, levy,
attachment, garnishment, or other legal process’ ”).

															These canons are valuable tools. But applying
either to (c)(2) is like using a hammer to pound in a screw—it
looks like it might work, but using it botches the job. Unlike the
pattern to which the noscitur canon applies, §1512(c) is not
a list of terms that includes an ambiguous word. So the Court does
not do what it does when applying noscitur: select between
multiple accepted meanings of the words “obstructs,” “influences,”
and “impedes.” Instead, it modifies those words by adding an
adverbial phrase: obstructs, influences or impedes by
“impair[ing] the availability or integrity for use in an
official proceeding of records, documents, or objects.”
Ante, at 16 (emphasis added). The ejusdem canon is an
equally poor fit. Unlike the pattern to which ejusdem
applies, (c)(2) is “not a general or collective term
following a list of specific items to which a particular statutory
command is applicable.” United States v. Aguilar,
515 U.S.
593, 615 (1995) (Scalia, J., concurring in part and dissenting
in part). Instead, (c)(1) and (c)(2) are “distinct and independent
prohibitions.” Ibid. Though they share a subject and an
adverb—“[w]hoever corruptly”—the two clauses contain different
verbs that take different objects. §1512(c). Moreover, (c)(1) has a
separate mens rea provision that further disrupts the
connection between the clauses.

															To my knowledge, we have never applied either of
these canons to a statute resembling §1512(c). Rather than identify
such a case, the Court invents examples of a sign at the zoo and a
football league rule. Ante, at 5–6. The zoo example (“do not
pet, feed, yell or throw objects at the animals, or otherwise
disturb them”) does not help, because it mimics the typical
ejusdem format of specific words followed by a catchall. The
list of specific verbs makes clear that the cleanup phrase
(“otherwise disturb”) is limited to conduct that involves direct
interaction with the animals. But in the absence of a laundry list
followed by a catchall, it is hard to see why the ejusdem
canon fits. Ali v. Federal Bureau of Prisons,
552 U.S.
214, 225 (2008) (“The absence of a list of specific items
undercuts the inference embodied in ejusdem generis that
Congress remained focused on the common attribute when it used the
catchall phrase”). And §1512(c) does not follow the
laundry-list-plus-catchall pattern.

															The Court’s football example is only slightly
better. As a refresher:

															“[A] football league might adopt a rule
that players must not ‘grab, twist, or pull a facemask, helmet, or
other equipment with the intent to injure a player, or otherwise
attack, assault, or harm any player.’ If a linebacker shouts
insults at the quarterback and hurts his feelings, has the
linebacker nonetheless followed the rule? Of course he has. The
examples of prohibited actions all concern dangerous physical
conduct that might inflict bodily harm; trash talk is simply not of
that kind.” Ante, at 6.

															Put aside that it is hard to imagine anyone
describing “trash talk” as inflicting an “injury” or “harming” a
player in a football game. The league rule plainly forecloses the
possibility. Consistent with the noscitur canon, “harm”
takes its meaning from its companions “attack” and “assault.” And
while the Court tries to track §1512(c)’s structure by adding an
extra intent clause, the two clauses in its example are still
tightly focused on actions directed at the player. (After
all, who is wearing the facemask, helmet, or other equipment?)
Given that shared theme, it is easy to understand that the first
clause’s focus on physical conduct limits the (only slightly) more
general clause. But §1512(c)’s subsections are not so closely
related—(c)(1) focuses specifically on objects in a proceeding, and
(c)(2) broadens the lens to the proceeding itself.

															Consider a rule that actually mirrors
§1512(c):

															“Any player who:

															“(1) punches, chokes, or kicks an opposing
player with the intent to remove him from the game; or

															“(2) otherwise interrupts, hinders, or
interferes with the game,

															“shall be suspended.”

															While the specific verbs in the first clause
involve actions directed at an opposing player, the second clause
is a separate prohibition with an entirely different object.
Imagine that, just before the opposing team’s kicker attempts a
field goal, players leave the sidelines and storm the field, some
tackling referees in the process. Those players have surely
“interrupt[ed], hinder[ed], or interfer[ed] with the game,” even
though they have not physically injured any opponent. This
hypothetical, not the Court’s, is analogous to §1512(c)—and it
supports the Government’s interpretation.

															2

															The Court next recruits help from
Begay, which interprets an “otherwise” clause in the Armed
Career Criminal Act. Ante, at 6; 553 U. S., at 140. The
ACCA defines a “violent felony” as a felony that “is burglary,
arson, or extortion, involves use of explosives, or otherwise
involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical
injury.” 18 U. S. C. §924(e)(2)(B)(ii). Begay
holds that the example crimes limit the catchall clause to “crimes
that are roughly similar . . . to the examples
themselves.” 553 U. S., at 143. So too here, the Court
reasons, the list of crimes in (c)(1) limits the “otherwise” clause
in (c)(2).

															But §1512(c) is structured differently than the
statute in Begay. While §1512(c) contains two distinct
criminal prohibitions—(c)(1) and (c)(2)—the statutory definition in
Begay contained a list of examples followed immediately by a
residual clause. The latter structure more readily supports
interpreting the general clause in light of the specifics, much
like a statute to which the ejusdem canon would apply.
Moreover, the residual clause at issue in Begay called out
for a limiting principle—what is a “serious potential risk of
physical injury?” The breadth itself was a cue that the interpreter
should read back to find some limit. See id., at 142–143.
Subsection (c)(2)’s “otherwise” clause, by contrast, stands on its
own.

															Postscript: Seven years after Begay was
decided, we held ACCA’s residual clause void for vagueness.
Johnson v. United States, 576
U.S. 591, 597 (2015). So the clause is not only
distinguishable, but also a poor model for statutory
interpretation.

															3

															The Court argues that “there would have been
scant reason for Congress to provide any specific examples” in
(c)(1) if (c)(2) covered all forms of obstructive conduct.
Ante, at 8. Conduct like destroying and concealing records
“obstructs, influences, or impedes a[n] official proceeding,” so
Congress could have enacted just (c)(2) and been done with it. On
the Government’s interpretation, the Court asserts, the second
prohibition swallows the first. If (c)(1) has any function, it must
be to cast light (and impose limits) on (c)(2).

															What the Court does not say is that its
rewrite also eliminates the need for (c)(1)’s examples. The Court’s
interpretation assumes that Congress used a convoluted, two-step
approach to enact a prohibition on “impair[ing] the integrity or
availability of records, documents, or other objects for use in an
official proceeding.” So why didn’t Congress just say that? And if
the Court is right about what (c)(2) means, why do we need the
specific examples in (c)(1)? Those acts are already covered. The
problem of (c)(2) subsuming (c)(1) is therefore not unique to my
theory.

															It bears emphasis, though, that the broad
overlap makes sense, given the statute’s backstory. When the Enron
scandal occurred, Congress (along with the general public) was
taken aback to discover that seemingly criminal conduct was
actually not a federal crime. As it then existed, §1512 had a
loophole: It imposed liability on those who persuaded others
to destroy documents, but not on the people who themselves
destroyed documents. Ante, at 9–10. Congress enacted
§1512(c) to close this “Enron gap.” Subsection (c)(1) deals with
the particular problem at hand—document destruction. Subsection
(c)(2) reflects Congress’s desire to avoid future surprises: It is
“a catchall for matters not specifically contemplated—known
unknowns.” Republic of Iraq v. Beaty, 556 U.S.
848, 860 (2009).

															So contrary to the Court’s suggestion, it would
not be “peculiar” for (c)(2) to cover conduct “far beyond the
document shredding and similar scenarios that prompted the
legislation in the first place.” Ante, at 10. Enron exposed
more than the need to prohibit evidence spoliation—it also exposed
the need to close statutory gaps. And in any event, statutes often
reach beyond the “principal evil” that animated them. Oncale
v. Sundowner Offshore Services, Inc., 523 U.S.
75, 79 (1998). That is not grounds for narrowing them, because
“it is ultimately the provisions of our laws rather than the
principal concerns of our legislators by which we are governed.”
Ibid.

															While the Court insists that (c)(1) limits
(c)(2), it cannot seem to settle on the “common attribute” in the
first subsection that cabins the second. See Ali, 552
U. S., at 225. On one hand, the Court says that “(c)(2) makes
it a crime to impair the availability or integrity of records,
documents, or objects used in an official proceeding.”
Ante, at 8 (emphasis added). This “physical evidence”
limitation tracks the District Court’s interpretation. See
United States v. Miller, 589 F. Supp. 3d 60, 78
(DC 2022). On the other hand, the Court says that (c)(2) prohibits
“impairing the availability or integrity of other things
used in an official proceeding,” such as “witness testimony” or
“intangible information.” Ante, at 9. This broader “evidence
impairment” theory resembles Judge Katsas’s interpretation. 64
F. 4th 329, 363 (CADC 2023) (dissenting opinion).

															Both formulations are problematic—and not only
because both are atextual. The first, focused solely on physical
items, would leave (c)(2) with almost no work to do. Subsection
(c)(1) already prohibits “alter[ing], destroy[ing], mutilat[ing],
or conceal[ing]” documents, records, or objects. This essentially
covers the waterfront of acts that impair the integrity or
availability of objects. True, (c)(2) could also encompass
“cover[ing] up, falsif[ying], or mak[ing] a false entry in” a
record or document. See 18 U. S. C. §1519. But it seems
“unlikely” that Congress used the “expansive” language of (c)(2)
“to address such narrow concerns.” 64 F. 4th, at 344. The
somewhat amorphous “other things” limitation has the benefit of
giving (c)(2) a wider berth, but it is unclear how the Court landed
on it. The term does not appear in (c)(1) or in §1512’s surrounding
subsections, which refer specifically to records, documents,
objects, and testimony. The “other things” formulation comes from
the Court, not Congress.

															The Court’s uncertainty about the relevant
“common attribute” is a tell that Congress did not intend to define
(c)(2) by reference to (c)(1). Indeed, “[h]ad Congress intended to
limit [§1512(c)(2)]’s reach” as the Court asserts, it “easily could
have written” the catchall to say “otherwise impair the integrity
or availability of records, documents, objects, or other things for
use in an official proceeding.” Ali, 552 U. S., at 227;
see ante, at 8–9.[2] It
did not, and we should not pretend that it did.

															B

															The Court relies on statutory context to
“confir[m] that (c)(2) is limited by the scope of (c)(1).”
Ante, at 10. As the Court sees it, interpreting (c)(2)
according to its plain text would render other obstruction
provisions, within §1512 and throughout Chapter 73, superfluous.
Ante, at 10–12.

															The Court exaggerates. Subsection (c)(2) applies
only to conduct that obstructs an “official proceeding.” The Court
highlights several provisions that cover obstruction of
investigations. See, e.g., 18
U. S. C. §§1510(a), 1511(a), 1516, 1517, 1518, 1519. The
circuits have held that criminal investigations do not qualify as
“official proceedings.” See, e.g., United
States v. Ermoian, 752 F.3d 1165, 1172 (CA9 2013);
United States v. Ramos, 537 F.3d 439, 463 (CA5 2008).
Likewise, not every provision in §1512 relates to an official
proceeding; instead, several target the obstruction of
communications to judges and law enforcement about the commission
of federal offenses. 18 U. S. C. §§1512(a)(1)(C),
(a)(2)(C), (b)(3), (d)(1)(2).

															The Court responds by stressing that for
purposes of §1512, “an official proceeding need not be pending or
about to be instituted.” §1512(f )(1); ante, at 13.
Because obstruction of investigations or communications could end
up obstructing the initiation of a future official proceeding, the
Court reasons that (c)(2) may still swallow those other provisions.
But we have previously construed federal obstruction offenses
similar to §1512(c) to require a tighter link between the
obstructive conduct and the relevant proceeding. Under the “nexus”
requirement, the defendant’s conduct must have a “relationship in
time, causation, or logic” with the proceeding. Aguilar, 515
U. S., at 599 (adopting nexus requirement for §1503’s omnibus
clause). And the defendant must act in “contemplation” of a
“particular official proceeding.” Arthur Andersen LLP v.
United States, 544 U.S.
696, 708 (2005) (adopting nexus requirement for §1512(b)(2)).
The circuits have unanimously applied this requirement to §1512(c).
See United States v. Young, 916 F.3d 368, 386 (CA4
2019) (collecting cases). This element eliminates much of the
overlap that the Court perceives between (c)(2) and the provisions
that do not require an “official proceeding.”

															Moreover, §§1512(a)(1)(A) and (d)(1) prohibit
preventing the mere attendance of any person in an official
proceeding. Preventing attendance will not always have the effect
of obstructing, influencing, or impeding the proceeding. And
§1512(d)(1) makes it a crime to intentionally harass someone
and thereby dissuade her from testifying in an official proceeding.
In contrast to (c)(2), this provision—which carries a significantly
lower maximum penalty—does not require a defendant to act
“corruptly.”

															This is not to deny that (c)(2)—if allowed its
broad, ordinary meaning—overlaps with several offenses in Chapter
73. See ante, at 10–11. Even so, (c)(2) still leaves a
healthy amount of work for other obstruction offenses. And besides,
“substantial” overlap “is not uncommon in criminal statutes.”
Loughrin v. United States, 573
U.S. 351, 358, n. 4 (2014); see also Hubbard v.
United States, 514 U.S.
695, 714, n. 14 (1995) (opinion of Stevens, J.). “The mere
fact that two federal criminal statutes criminalize similar conduct
says little about the scope of either.” Pasquantino v.
United States, 544 U.S.
349, 358, n. 4 (2005). That is especially true here,
because Congress enacted (c)(2) after it had already enacted
other subsections of §1512, as well as obstruction offenses like
§§1503 and 1505. The redundancy argument would have more force if
(c)(2) “render[ed] superfluous an entire provision passed in
proximity as part of the same Act.” Yates v.
United States, 574 U.S.
528, 543 (2015) (plurality opinion) (emphasis added). As it
stands, the canon against surplusage does not provide any reason to
artificially narrow (c)(2)’s scope.

															In any event, the Court’s formulation does not
begin to cure the statutory overlap. Killing a person with the
intent to prevent the production of a record in an official
proceeding constitutes conduct that impairs the availability of a
record for an official proceeding. 18 U. S. C.
§1512(a)(1)(B). Using physical force against a person to influence
testimony in an official proceeding counts as impairing the
integrity of “other things” used in an official proceeding.
§1512(a)(2)(A). And impairing the availability or integrity of
documents for use in an official proceeding will often
“influenc[e], obstruc[t], or imped[e] . . . the due
administration of justice.” §1503(a); see also §1515(a)(1)(A)
(“ ‘official proceeding’ ” includes “a proceeding before
a judge or court of the United States”). Examples abound. See,
e.g., §§1505, 1512(a)(1)(A), (a)(2)(B), (b)(1),
(b)(2), (d)(1). “[T]he canon against surplusage merely favors that
interpretation which avoids surplusage”—and on that score,
the Court’s interpretation fares no better than mine.
Freeman v. Quicken Loans, Inc., 566 U.S.
624, 635 (2012).

															In fact, the broader statutory context works
against the Court’s interpretation. Congress did not select
the verbs “obstruct,” “influence,” and “impede” at random. Those
words were already in §1503, which prohibits “corruptly or by
threats or force, or by any threatening letter or communication,
influenc[ing], obstruct[ing], or imped[ing] . . . the due
administration of justice.” We have described this “ ‘Omnibus
Clause’ ” as a “catchall,” because it follows several specific
proscriptions against coercive behavior toward jurors and court
officers. Aguilar, 515 U. S., at 598. Courts have
routinely declined to “rea[d] the omnibus clause” as limited to
“acts similar in manner to those prescribed by the statute’s
specific language.” United States v. Howard, 569 F.2d
1331, 1333, 1335 (CA5 1978) (collecting cases). And Justice Scalia
agreed that ejusdem generis did not apply to limit the
Omnibus Clause, “one of the several distinct and independent
prohibitions contained in §1503 that share only the word ‘Whoever,’
which begins the statute, and the penalty provision which ends it.”
Aguilar, 515 U. S., at 615 (opinion concurring in part
and dissenting in part). Section 1512(c) follows the very same
pattern.

															C

															The Court concludes with an appeal to
consequences: Construing (c)(2) broadly would “expos[e] activists
and lobbyists alike to decades in prison.” Ante, at 14. This
fear is overstated.

															To begin with, the Court ignores that (c)(2)
requires proof that a defendant acted “corruptly.” The meaning of
this term is unsettled, but all of its possible definitions limit
the scope of liability. On one proposed interpretation, a defendant
acts corruptly by “ ‘us[ing] unlawful means, or act[ing] with
an unlawful purpose, or both.’ ” United States v.
Robertson, 103 F. 4th 1, 8 (CADC 2023) (approving jury
instructions for (c)(2)). On another, a defendant acts “corruptly”
if he “act[s] ‘with an intent to procure an unlawful benefit either
for himself or for some other person.’ ” 64 F. 4th, at
352 (Walker, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment)
(quoting Marinello, 584 U. S., at 21; alterations
omitted). Under either, the “corruptly” element should screen out
innocent activists and lobbyists who engage in lawful activity. And
if not, those defendants can bring as-applied First Amendment
challenges.

															The Court also emphasizes (c)(2)’s 20-year
maximum penalty. Ante, at 14–15. But it simultaneously
“glosses over the absence of any prescribed minimum.” Yates,
574 U. S., at 569 (Kagan, J., dissenting). “Congress
presumably enacts laws with high maximums and no minimums when it
thinks the prohibited conduct may run the gamut from major to
minor.” Ibid. Indeed, given the breadth of its terms, (c)(2)
naturally encompasses actions that range in severity. Congress
presumably trusted District Courts to impose sentences commensurate
with the defendant’s particular conduct.

															*  *  *

															There is no getting around it: Section
1512(c)(2) is an expansive statute. Yet Congress, not this Court,
weighs the “pros and cons of whether a statute should sweep broadly
or narrowly.” United States v. Rodgers, 466 U.S.
475, 484 (1984). Once Congress has set the outer bounds of
liability, the Executive Branch has the discretion to select
particular cases to prosecute within those boundaries. By
atextually narrowing §1512(c)(2), the Court has failed to respect
the prerogatives of the political branches. Cf. ante, at 15.
I respectfully dissent.

Notes

 The D. C. Circuit held,
and this Court does not dispute, that Congress’s joint session on
January 6, 2021, qualifies as an “ ‘official
