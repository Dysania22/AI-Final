															SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

															_________________

															No. 22–721

															_________________

															DAMIAN McELRATH, PETITIONER v.
GEORGIA

															on writ of certiorari to the supreme court of
georgia

															[February 21, 2024]

															

															Justice Alito, concurring.

															I join the opinion of the Court but write to
clarify my understanding of what we have held. In this case, there
was indisputably an acquittal on the malice-murder charge. The jury
returned a not-guilty verdict on that count, the trial judge
entered a judgment of acquittal on that count, and petitioner
appealed that part of the judgment. Because the Constitution does
not permit appellate review of an acquittal, the State Supreme
Court’s decision must be reversed. As I understand it, our holding
extends no further.

															As the Court recognizes, the situation here is
different from one in which a trial judge refuses to accept
inconsistent verdicts and thus sends the jury back to deliberate
further. Some States follow this practice, and our decision does
not address it. We have held that federal law does not prevent the
acceptance of inconsistent verdicts, United States v.
Powell, 469 U.S.
57, 68–69 (1984); Dunn v. United States,
284 U.S.
390, 393–394 (1932), but we have never held that the
Constitution mandates that practice—which is not necessarily
favorable to either the prosecution or the defense. Nothing that we
say today should be understood to express any view about whether a
not-guilty verdict that is inconsistent with a verdict on another
count and is not accepted by the trial judge constitutes an
“acquittal” for double jeopardy purposes.
