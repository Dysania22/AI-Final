															Chief Justice Roberts delivered the opinion of
the Court.

															Since our decision in Chevron
U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense
Council, Inc., 467 U.S.
837 (1984), we have sometimes required courts to defer to
“permissible” agency interpretations of the statutes those agencies
administer—even when a reviewing court reads the statute
differently. In these cases we consider whether that doctrine
should be overruled.

															I

															Our Chevron doctrine requires courts to
use a two-step framework to interpret statutes administered by
federal agencies. After determining that a case satisfies the
various preconditions we have set for Chevron to apply, a
reviewing court must first assess “whether Congress has directly
spoken to the precise question at issue.” Id., at 842. If,
and only if, congressional intent is “clear,” that is the end of
the inquiry. Ibid. But if the court determines that “the
statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue”
at hand, the court must, at Chevron’s second step, defer to
the agency’s interpretation if it “is based on a permissible
construction of the statute.” Id., at 843. The reviewing
courts in each of the cases before us applied Chevron’s
framework to resolve in favor of the Government challenges to the
same agency rule.

															A

															Before 1976, unregulated foreign vessels
dominated fishing in the international waters off the U. S.
coast, which began just 12 nautical miles offshore. See,
e.g., S. Rep. No. 94–459, pp. 2–3 (1975). Recognizing
the resultant overfishing and the need for sound management of
fishery resources, Congress enacted the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery
Conservation and Management Act (MSA). See 90 Stat. 331 (codified
as amended at 16 U. S. C. §1801 et seq.). The
MSA and subsequent amendments extended the jurisdiction of the
United States to 200 nautical miles beyond the U. S.
territorial sea and claimed “exclusive fishery management authority
over all fish” within that area, known as the “exclusive economic
zone.” §1811(a); see Presidential Proclamation No. 5030, 3 CFR 22
(1983 Comp.); §§101, 102, 90 Stat. 336. The National Marine
Fisheries Service (NMFS) administers the MSA under a delegation
from the Secretary of Commerce.

															The MSA established eight regional fishery
management councils composed of representatives from the coastal
States, fishery stakeholders, and NMFS. See 16 U. S. C.
§§1852(a), (b). The councils develop fishery management plans,
which NMFS approves and promulgates as final regulations. See
§§1852(h), 1854(a). In service of the statute’s fishery
conservation and management goals, see §1851(a), the MSA requires
that certain provisions—such as “a mechanism for specifying annual
catch limits . . . at a level such that overfishing does
not occur,” §1853(a)(15)—be included in these plans, see §1853(a).
The plans may also include additional discretionary provisions. See
§1853(b). For example, plans may “prohibit, limit, condition, or
require the use of specified types and quantities of fishing gear,
fishing vessels, or equipment,” §1853(b)(4); “reserve a portion of
the allowable biological catch of the fishery for use in scientific
research,” §1853(b)(11); and “prescribe such other measures,
requirements, or conditions and restrictions as are determined to
be necessary and appropriate for the conservation and management of
the fishery,” §1853(b)(14).

															Relevant here, a plan may also require that “one
or more observers be carried on board” domestic vessels “for the
purpose of collecting data necessary for the conservation and
management of the fishery.” §1853(b)(8). The MSA specifies three
groups that must cover costs associated with observers: (1) foreign
fishing vessels operating within the exclusive economic zone (which
must carry observers), see §§1821(h)(1)(A), (h)(4), (h)(6);
(2) vessels participating in certain limited access privilege
programs, which impose quotas permitting fishermen to harvest only
specific quantities of a fishery’s total allowable catch, see
§§1802(26), 1853a(c)(1)(H), (e)(2), 1854(d)(2); and (3) vessels
within the jurisdiction of the North Pacific Council, where many of
the largest and most successful commercial fishing enterprises in
the Nation operate, see §1862(a). In the latter two cases, the MSA
expressly caps the relevant fees at two or three percent of the
value of fish harvested on the vessels. See §§1854(d)(2)(B),
1862(b)(2)(E). And in general, it authorizes the Secretary to
impose “sanctions” when “any payment required for observer services
provided to or contracted by an owner or operator . . .
has not been paid.” §1858(g)(1)(D).

															The MSA does not contain similar terms
addressing whether Atlantic herring fishermen may be required to
bear costs associated with any observers a plan may mandate. And at
one point, NMFS fully funded the observer coverage the New England
Fishery Management Council required in its plan for the Atlantic
herring fishery. See 79 Fed. Reg. 8792 (2014). In 2013, however,
the council proposed amending its fishery management plans to
empower it to require fishermen to pay for observers if federal
funding became unavailable. Several years later, NMFS promulgated a
rule approving the amendment. See 85 Fed. Reg. 7414 (2020).

															With respect to the Atlantic herring fishery,
the Rule created an industry funded program that aims to ensure
observer coverage on 50 percent of trips undertaken by vessels with
certain types of permits. Under that program, vessel
representatives must “declare into” a fishery before beginning a
trip by notifying NMFS of the trip and announcing the species the
vessel intends to harvest. If NMFS determines that an observer is
required, but declines to assign a Government-paid one, the vessel
must contract with and pay for a Government-certified third-party
observer. NMFS estimated that the cost of such an observer would be
up to $710 per day, reducing annual returns to the vessel owner by
up to 20 percent. See id., at 7417–7418.

															B

															Petitioners Loper Bright Enterprises, Inc.,
H&L Axelsson, Inc., Lund Marr Trawlers LLC, and Scombrus One
LLC are family businesses that operate in the Atlantic herring
fishery. In February 2020, they challenged the Rule under the MSA,
16 U. S. C. §1855(f ), which incorporates the
Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U. S. C. §551
et seq. In relevant part, they argued that the MSA does
not authorize NMFS to mandate that they pay for observers required
by a fishery management plan. The District Court granted summary
judgment to the Government. It concluded that the MSA authorized
the Rule, but noted that even if these petitioners’ “arguments were
enough to raise an ambiguity in the statutory text,” deference to
the agency’s interpretation would be warranted under
Chevron. 544 F. Supp. 3d 82, 107 (DC 2021); see
id., at 103–107.

															A divided panel of the D. C. Circuit
affirmed. See 45 F. 4th 359 (2022). The majority addressed
various provisions of the MSA and concluded that it was not “wholly
unambiguous” whether NMFS may require Atlantic herring fishermen to
pay for observers. Id., at 366. Because there remained “some
question” as to Congress’s intent, id., at 369, the court
proceeded to Chevron’s second step and deferred to the
agency’s interpretation as a “reasonable” construction of the MSA,
45 F. 4th, at 370. In dissent, Judge Walker concluded that
Congress’s silence on industry funded observers for the Atlantic
herring fishery—coupled with the express provision for such
observers in other fisheries and on foreign vessels—unambiguously
indicated that NMFS lacked the authority to “require [Atlantic
herring] fishermen to pay the wages of at-sea monitors.”
Id., at 375.

															C

															Petitioners Relentless Inc., Huntress Inc.,
and Seafreeze Fleet LLC own two vessels that operate in the
Atlantic herring fishery: the F/V Relentless and the F/V
Persistence.[1] These
vessels use small-mesh bottom-trawl gear and can freeze fish at
sea, so they can catch more species of fish and take longer trips
than other vessels (about 10 to 14 days, as opposed to the more
typical 2 to 4). As a result, they generally declare into multiple
fisheries per trip so they can catch whatever the ocean offers up.
If the vessels declare into the Atlantic herring fishery for a
particular trip, they must carry an observer for that trip if NMFS
selects the trip for coverage, even if they end up harvesting fewer
herring than other vessels—or no herring at all.

															This set of petitioners, like those in the
D. C. Circuit case, filed a suit challenging the Rule as
unauthorized by the MSA. The District Court, like the D. C.
Circuit, deferred to NMFS’s contrary interpretation under
Chevron and thus granted summary judgment to the Government.
See 561 F. Supp. 3d 226, 234–238 (RI 2021).

															The First Circuit affirmed. See 62 F. 4th
621 (2023). It relied on a “default norm” that regulated entities
must bear compliance costs, as well as the MSA’s sanctions
provision, Section 1858(g)(1)(D). See id., at 629–631. And
it rejected petitioners’ argument that the express statutory
authorization of three industry funding programs demonstrated that
NMFS lacked the broad implicit authority it asserted to impose such
a program for the Atlantic herring fishery. See id., at
631–633. The court ultimately concluded that the “[a]gency’s
interpretation of its authority to require at-sea monitors who are
paid for by owners of regulated vessels does not ‘exceed[ ]
the bounds of the permissible.’ ” Id., at 633–634
(quoting Barnhart v. Walton, 535
U.S. 212, 218 (2002); alteration in original). In reaching that
conclusion, the First Circuit stated that it was applying
Chevron’s two-step framework. 62 F. 4th, at 628. But it
did not explain which aspects of its analysis were relevant to
which of Chevron’s two steps. Similarly, it declined to
decide whether the result was “a product of Chevron step one
or step two.” Id., at 634.

															We granted certiorari in both cases, limited to
the question whether Chevron should be overruled or
clarified. See 601 U. S. ___ (2023); 598 U. S. ___
(2023).[2]

															II

															A

															Article III of the Constitution assigns to the
Federal Judiciary the responsibility and power to adjudicate
“Cases” and “Controversies”—concrete disputes with consequences for
the parties involved. The Framers appreciated that the laws judges
would necessarily apply in resolving those disputes would not
always be clear. Cognizant of the limits of human language and
foresight, they anticipated that “[a]ll new laws, though penned
with the greatest technical skill, and passed on the fullest and
most mature deliberation,” would be “more or less obscure and
equivocal, until their meaning” was settled “by a series of
particular discussions and adjudications.” The Federalist
No. 37, p. 236 (J. Cooke ed. 1961) (J. Madison).

															The Framers also envisioned that the final
“interpretation of the laws” would be “the proper and peculiar
province of the courts.” Id., No. 78, at 525 (A.
Hamilton). Unlike the political branches, the courts would by
design exercise “neither Force nor Will, but merely judgment.”
Id., at 523. To ensure the “steady, upright and impartial
administration of the laws,” the Framers structured the
Constitution to allow judges to exercise that judgment independent
of influence from the political branches. Id., at 522; see
id., at 522–524; Stern v. Marshall, 564 U.S.
462, 484 (2011).

															This Court embraced the Framers’ understanding
of the judicial function early on. In the foundational decision of
Marbury v. Madison, Chief Justice Marshall famously
declared that “[i]t is emphatically the province and duty of the
judicial department to say what the law is.” 1 Cranch 137, 177
(1803). And in the following decades, the Court understood
“interpret[ing] the laws, in the last resort,” to be a “solemn
duty” of the Judiciary. United States v. Dickson, 15
Pet. 141, 162 (1841) (Story, J., for the Court). When the meaning
of a statute was at issue, the judicial role was to “interpret the
act of Congress, in order to ascertain the rights of the parties.”
Decatur v. Paulding, 14 Pet. 497, 515 (1840).

															The Court also recognized from the outset,
though, that exercising independent judgment often included
according due respect to Executive Branch interpretations of
federal statutes. For example, in Edwards’ Lessee v.
Darby, 12 Wheat. 206 (1827), the Court explained that “[i]n
the construction of a doubtful and ambiguous law, the
contemporaneous construction of those who were called upon to act
under the law, and were appointed to carry its provisions into
effect, is entitled to very great respect.” Id., at 210; see
also United States v. Vowell, 5 Cranch 368, 372
(1809) (Marshall, C. J., for the Court).

															Such respect was thought especially warranted
when an Executive Branch interpretation was issued roughly
contemporaneously with enactment of the statute and remained
consistent over time. See Dickson, 15 Pet., at 161;
United States v. Alabama Great Southern R. Co.,
142 U.S.
615, 621 (1892); National Lead Co. v. United
States, 252 U.S.
140, 145–146 (1920). That is because “the longstanding
‘practice of the government’ ”—like any other interpretive
aid—“can inform [a court’s] determination of ‘what the law
is.’ ” NLRB v. Noel Canning, 573 U.S.
513, 525 (2014) (first quoting McCulloch v.
Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 401 (1819); then quoting
Marbury, 1 Cranch, at 177). The Court also gave “the most
respectful consideration” to Executive Branch interpretations
simply because “[t]he officers concerned [were] usually able men,
and masters of the subject,” who were “[n]ot unfrequently
. . . the draftsmen of the laws they [were] afterwards
called upon to interpret.” United States v. Moore,
95 U.S.
760, 763 (1878); see also Jacobs v. Prichard,
223 U.S.
200, 214 (1912).

															“Respect,” though, was just that. The views of
the Executive Branch could inform the judgment of the Judiciary,
but did not supersede it. Whatever respect an Executive Branch
interpretation was due, a judge “certainly would not be bound to
adopt the construction given by the head of a department.”
Decatur, 14 Pet., at 515; see also Burnet v.
Chicago Portrait Co., 285 U.S.
1, 16 (1932). Otherwise, judicial judgment would not be
independent at all. As Justice Story put it, “in cases where [a
court’s] own judgment . . . differ[ed] from that of other
high functionaries,” the court was “not at liberty to surrender, or
to waive it.” Dickson, 15 Pet., at 162.

															B

															The New Deal ushered in a “rapid expansion of
the administrative process.” United States v. Morton Salt
Co., 338 U.S.
632, 644 (1950). But as new agencies with new powers
proliferated, the Court continued to adhere to the traditional
understanding that questions of law were for courts to decide,
exercising independent judgment.

															During this period, the Court often treated
agency determinations of fact as binding on the courts,
provided that there was “evidence to support the findings.” St.
Joseph Stock Yards Co. v. United States, 298 U.S.
38, 51 (1936). “When the legislature itself acts within the
broad field of legislative discretion,” the Court reasoned, “its
determinations are conclusive.” Ibid. Congress could
therefore “appoint[ ] an agent to act within that sphere of
legislative authority” and “endow the agent with power to make
findings of fact which are conclusive, provided the
requirements of due process which are specially applicable to such
an agency are met, as in according a fair hearing and acting upon
evidence and not arbitrarily.” Ibid. (emphasis added).

															But the Court did not extend similar deference
to agency resolutions of questions of law. It instead made
clear, repeatedly, that “[t]he interpretation of the meaning of
statutes, as applied to justiciable controversies,” was
“exclusively a judicial function.” United States v.
American Trucking Assns., Inc., 310
U.S. 534, 544 (1940); see also Social Security Bd. v.
Nierotko, 327 U.S.
358, 369 (1946); Medo Photo Supply Corp. v. NLRB,
321 U.S.
678, 681–682, n. 1 (1944). The Court understood, in the
words of Justice Brandeis, that “[t]he supremacy of law demands
that there shall be opportunity to have some court decide whether
an erroneous rule of law was applied.” St. Joseph Stock
Yards, 298 U. S., at 84 (concurring opinion). It also
continued to note, as it long had, that the informed judgment of
the Executive Branch—especially in the form of an interpretation
issued contemporaneously with the enactment of the statute—could be
entitled to “great weight.” American Trucking Assns., 310
U. S., at 549.

															Perhaps most notably along those lines, in
Skidmore v. Swift & Co., 323
U.S. 134 (1944), the Court explained that the “interpretations
and opinions” of the relevant agency, “made in pursuance of
official duty” and “based upon . . . specialized
experience,” “constitute[d] a body of experience and informed
judgment to which courts and litigants [could] properly resort for
guidance,” even on legal questions. Id., at 139–140. “The
weight of such a judgment in a particular case,” the Court
observed, would “depend upon the thoroughness evident in its
consideration, the validity of its reasoning, its consistency with
earlier and later pronouncements, and all those factors which give
it power to persuade, if lacking power to control.” Id., at
140.

															On occasion, to be sure, the Court applied
deferential review upon concluding that a particular statute
empowered an agency to decide how a broad statutory term applied to
specific facts found by the agency. For example, in Gray v.
Powell, 314 U.S.
402 (1941), the Court deferred to an administrative conclusion
that a coal-burning railroad that had arrangements with several
coal mines was not a coal “producer” under the Bituminous Coal Act
of 1937. Congress had “specifically” granted the agency the
authority to make that determination. Id., at 411. The Court
thus reasoned that “[w]here, as here, a determination has been left
to an administrative body, this delegation will be respected and
the administrative conclusion left untouched” so long as the
agency’s decision constituted “a sensible exercise of judgment.”
Id., at 412–413. Similarly, in NLRB v. Hearst
Publications, Inc., 322 U.S.
111 (1944), the Court deferred to the determination of the
National Labor Relations Board that newsboys were “employee[s]”
within the meaning of the National Labor Relations Act. The Act
had, in the Court’s judgment, “assigned primarily” to the Board the
task of marking a “definitive limitation around the term
‘employee.’ ” Id., at 130. The Court accordingly viewed
its own role as “limited” to assessing whether the Board’s
determination had a “ ‘warrant in the record’ and a reasonable
basis in law.” Id., at 131.

															Such deferential review, though, was cabined to
factbound determinations like those at issue in Gray and
Hearst. Neither Gray nor Hearst purported to
refashion the longstanding judicial approach to questions of law.
In Gray, after deferring to the agency’s determination that
a particular entity was not a “producer” of coal, the Court went on
to discern, based on its own reading of the text, whether another
statutory term—“other disposal” of coal—encompassed a transaction
lacking a transfer of title. See 314 U. S., at 416–417. The
Court evidently perceived no basis for deference to the agency with
respect to that pure legal question. And in Hearst, the
Court proclaimed that “[u]ndoubtedly questions of statutory
interpretation . . . are for the courts to resolve,
giving appropriate weight to the judgment of those whose special
duty is to administer the questioned statute.” 322 U. S., at
130–131. At least with respect to questions it regarded as
involving “statutory interpretation,” the Court thus did not
disturb the traditional rule. It merely thought that a different
approach should apply where application of a statutory term was
sufficiently intertwined with the agency’s factfinding.

															In any event, the Court was far from consistent
in reviewing deferentially even such factbound statutory
determinations. Often the Court simply interpreted and applied the
statute before it. See K. Davis, Administrative Law §248,
p. 893 (1951) (“The one statement that can be made with
confidence about applicability of the doctrine of Gray v. Powell is
that sometimes the Supreme Court applies it and sometimes it does
not.”); B. Schwartz, Gray vs. Powell and the Scope of Review, 54
Mich. L. Rev. 1, 68 (1955) (noting an “embarrassingly large
number of Supreme Court decisions that do not adhere to the
doctrine of Gray v. Powell”). In one illustrative example,
the Court rejected the U. S. Price Administrator’s
determination that a particular warehouse was a “public utility”
entitled to an exemption from the Administrator’s General Maximum
Price Regulation. Despite the striking resemblance of that
administrative determination to those that triggered deference in
Gray and Hearst, the Court declined to “accept the
Administrator’s view in deference to administrative construction.”
Davies Warehouse Co. v. Bowles, 321 U.S.
144, 156 (1944). The Administrator’s view, the Court explained,
had “hardly seasoned or broadened into a settled administrative
practice,” and thus did not “overweigh the considerations” the
Court had “set forth as to the proper construction of the statute.”
Ibid.

															Nothing in the New Deal era or before it thus
resembled the deference rule the Court would begin applying decades
later to all varieties of agency interpretations of statutes.
Instead, just five years after Gray and two after
Hearst, Congress codified the opposite rule: the traditional
understanding that courts must “decide all relevant
questions of law.” 5 U. S. C. §706.[3]

															C

															Congress in 1946 enacted the APA “as a check
upon administrators whose zeal might otherwise have carried them to
excesses not contemplated in legislation creating their offices.”
Morton Salt, 338 U. S., at 644. It was the culmination
of a “comprehensive rethinking of the place of administrative
agencies in a regime of separate and divided powers.” Bowen
v. Michigan Academy of Family Physicians, 476 U.S.
667, 670–671 (1986).

															In addition to prescribing procedures for agency
action, the APA delineates the basic contours of judicial review of
such action. As relevant here, Section 706 directs that “[t]o the
extent necessary to decision and when presented, the reviewing
court shall decide all relevant questions of law, interpret
constitutional and statutory provisions, and determine the meaning
or applicability of the terms of an agency action.” 5
U. S. C. §706. It further requires courts to “hold
unlawful and set aside agency action, findings, and conclusions
found to be . . . not in accordance with law.”
§706(2)(A).

															The APA thus codifies for agency cases the
unremarkable, yet elemental proposition reflected by judicial
practice dating back to Marbury: that courts decide legal
questions by applying their own judgment. It specifies that courts,
not agencies, will decide “all relevant questions of law”
arising on review of agency action, §706 (emphasis added)—even
those involving ambiguous laws—and set aside any such action
inconsistent with the law as they interpret it. And it prescribes
no deferential standard for courts to employ in answering those
legal questions. That omission is telling, because Section 706
does mandate that judicial review of agency policymaking and
factfinding be deferential. See §706(2)(A) (agency action to be set
aside if “arbitrary, capricious, [or] an abuse of discretion”);
§706(2)(E) (agency factfinding in formal proceedings to be set
aside if “unsupported by substantial evidence”).

															In a statute designed to “serve as the
fundamental charter of the administrative state,” Kisor v.
Wilkie, 588 U.S. 558, 580 (2019) (plurality opinion)
(internal quotation marks omitted), Congress surely would have
articulated a similarly deferential standard applicable to
questions of law had it intended to depart from the settled pre-APA
understanding that deciding such questions was “exclusively a
judicial function,” American Trucking Assns., 310
U. S., at 544. But nothing in the APA hints at such a dramatic
departure. On the contrary, by directing courts to “interpret
constitutional and statutory provisions” without differentiating
between the two, Section 706 makes clear that agency
interpretations of statutes—like agency interpretations of the
Constitution—are not entitled to deference. Under the APA,
it thus “remains the responsibility of the court to decide whether
the law means what the agency says.” Perez v. Mortgage
Bankers Assn., 575 U.S.
92, 109 (2015) (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment).[4]

															The text of the APA means what it says. And a
look at its history if anything only underscores that plain
meaning. According to both the House and Senate Reports on the
legislation, Section 706 “provide[d] that questions of law are for
courts rather than agencies to decide in the last analysis.”
H. R. Rep. No. 1980, 79th Cong., 2d Sess., 44 (1946) (emphasis
added); accord, S. Rep. No. 752, 79th Cong., 1st Sess., 28
(1945). Some of the legislation’s most prominent supporters
articulated the same view. See 92 Cong. Rec. 5654 (1946) (statement
of Rep. Walter); P. McCarran, Improving “Administrative Justice”:
Hearings and Evidence; Scope of Judicial Review, 32
A. B. A. J. 827, 831 (1946). Even the Department of
Justice—an agency with every incentive to endorse a view of the APA
favorable to the Executive Branch—opined after its enactment that
Section 706 merely “restate[d] the present law as to the scope of
judicial review.” Dept. of Justice, Attorney General’s Manual on
the Administrative Procedure Act 108 (1947); see also Kisor,
588 U. S., at 582 (plurality opinion) (same). That “present
law,” as we have described, adhered to the traditional conception
of the judicial function. See supra, at 9–13.

															Various respected commentators contemporaneously
maintained that the APA required reviewing courts to exercise
independent judgment on questions of law. Professor John Dickinson,
for example, read the APA to “impose a clear mandate that all
[questions of law] shall be decided by the reviewing Court itself,
and in the exercise of its own independent judgment.”
Administrative Procedure Act: Scope and Grounds of Broadened
Judicial Review, 33 A. B. A. J. 434, 516 (1947).
Professor Bernard Schwartz noted that §706 “would seem
. . . to be merely a legislative restatement of the
familiar review principle that questions of law are for the
reviewing court, at the same time leaving to the courts the task of
determining in each case what are questions of law.” Mixed
Questions of Law and Fact and the Administrative Procedure Act, 19
Ford. L. Rev. 73, 84–85 (1950). And Professor Louis Jaffe, who
had served in several agencies at the advent of the New Deal,
thought that §706 leaves it up to the reviewing “court” to “decide
as a ‘question of law’ whether there is ‘discretion’ in the
premises”—that is, whether the statute at issue delegates
particular discretionary authority to an agency. Judicial Control
of Administrative Action 570 (1965).

															The APA, in short, incorporates the traditional
understanding of the judicial function, under which courts must
exercise independent judgment in determining the meaning of
statutory provisions. In exercising such judgment, though, courts
may—as they have from the start—seek aid from the interpretations
of those responsible for implementing particular statutes. Such
interpretations “constitute a body of experience and informed
judgment to which courts and litigants may properly resort for
guidance” consistent with the APA. Skidmore, 323 U. S.,
at 140. And interpretations issued contemporaneously with the
statute at issue, and which have remained consistent over time, may
be especially useful in determining the statute’s meaning. See
ibid.; American Trucking Assns., 310
U. S., at 549.

															In a case involving an agency, of course, the
statute’s meaning may well be that the agency is authorized to
exercise a degree of discretion. Congress has often enacted such
statutes. For example, some statutes “expressly delegate[ ]”
to an agency the authority to give meaning to a particular
statutory term. Batterton v. Francis, 432 U.S.
416, 425 (1977) (emphasis deleted).[5] Others empower an agency to prescribe rules to “fill up
the details” of a statutory scheme, Wayman v.
Southard, 10 Wheat. 1, 43 (1825), or to regulate subject to
the limits imposed by a term or phrase that “leaves agencies with
flexibility,” Michigan v. EPA, 576 U.S.
743, 752 (2015), such as “appropriate” or
“reasonable.”[6]

															When the best reading of a statute is that it
delegates discretionary authority to an agency, the role of the
reviewing court under the APA is, as always, to independently
interpret the statute and effectuate the will of Congress subject
to constitutional limits. The court fulfills that role by
recognizing constitutional delegations, “fix[ing] the boundaries of
[the] delegated authority,” H. Monaghan, Marbury and the
Administrative State, 83 Colum. L. Rev. 1, 27 (1983), and
ensuring the agency has engaged in “ ‘reasoned
decisionmaking’ ” within those boundaries, Michigan,
576 U. S., at 750 (quoting Allentown Mack Sales &
Service, Inc. v. NLRB, 522 U.S.
359, 374 (1998)); see also Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Assn. of
United States, Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Automobile Ins.
Co., 463 U.S.
29 (1983). By doing so, a court upholds the traditional
conception of the judicial function that the APA adopts.

															III

															The deference that Chevron requires of
courts reviewing agency action cannot be squared with the APA.

															A

															In the decades between the enactment of the
APA and this Court’s decision in Chevron, courts generally
continued to review agency interpretations of the statutes they
administer by independently examining each statute to determine its
meaning. Cf. T. Merrill, Judicial Deference to Executive Precedent,
101 Yale L. J. 969, 972–975 (1992). As an early proponent (and
later critic) of Chevron recounted, courts during this
period thus identified delegations of discretionary authority to
agencies on a “statute-by-statute basis.” A. Scalia, Judicial
Deference to Administrative Interpretations of Law, 1989 Duke
L. J. 511, 516.

															Chevron, decided in 1984 by a bare quorum
of six Justices, triggered a marked departure from the traditional
approach. The question in the case was whether an EPA regulation
“allow[ing] States to treat all of the pollution-emitting devices
within the same industrial grouping as though they were encased
within a single ‘bubble’ ” was consistent with the term
“stationary source” as used in the Clean Air Act. 467 U. S.,
at 840. To answer that question of statutory interpretation, the
Court articulated and employed a now familiar two-step approach
broadly applicable to review of agency action.

															The first step was to discern “whether Congress
ha[d] directly spoken to the precise question at issue.”
Id., at 842. The Court explained that “[i]f the intent of
Congress is clear, that is the end of the matter,” ibid.,
and courts were therefore to “reject administrative constructions
which are contrary to clear congressional intent,” id., at
843, n. 9. To discern such intent, the Court noted, a
reviewing court was to “employ[ ] traditional tools of
statutory construction.” Ibid.

															Without mentioning the APA, or acknowledging any
doctrinal shift, the Court articulated a second step applicable
when “Congress ha[d] not directly addressed the precise question at
issue.” Id., at 843. In such a case—that is, a case in which
“the statute [was] silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific
issue” at hand—a reviewing court could not “simply impose
its own construction on the statute, as would be necessary in the
absence of an administrative interpretation.” Ibid.
(footnote omitted). A court instead had to set aside the
traditional interpretive tools and defer to the agency if it had
offered “a permissible construction of the statute,” ibid.,
even if not “the reading the court would have reached if the
question initially had arisen in a judicial proceeding,”
ibid., n. 11. That directive was justified, according
to the Court, by the understanding that administering statutes
“requires the formulation of policy” to fill statutory “gap[s]”; by
the long judicial tradition of according “considerable weight” to
Executive Branch interpretations; and by a host of other
considerations, including the complexity of the regulatory scheme,
EPA’s “detailed and reasoned” consideration, the policy-laden
nature of the judgment supposedly required, and the agency’s
indirect accountability to the people through the President.
Id., at 843, 844, and n. 14, 865.

															Employing this new test, the Court concluded
that Congress had not addressed the question at issue with the
necessary “level of specificity” and that EPA’s interpretation was
“entitled to deference.” Id., at 865. It did not matter
why Congress, as the Court saw it, had not squarely
addressed the question, see ibid., or that “the agency ha[d]
from time to time changed its interpretation,” id., at 863.
The latest EPA interpretation was a permissible reading of the
Clean Air Act, so under the Court’s new rule, that reading
controlled.

															Initially, Chevron “seemed destined to
obscurity.” T. Merrill, The Story of Chevron: The Making of
an Accidental Landmark, 66 Admin. L. Rev. 253, 276 (2014). The
Court did not at first treat it as the watershed decision it was
fated to become; it was hardly cited in cases involving statutory
questions of agency authority. See ibid. But within a few
years, both this Court and the courts of appeals were routinely
invoking its two-step framework as the governing standard in such
cases. See id., at 276–277. As the Court did so, it
revisited the doctrine’s justifications. Eventually, the Court
decided that Chevron rested on “a presumption that Congress,
when it left ambiguity in a statute meant for implementation by an
agency, understood that the ambiguity would be resolved, first and
foremost, by the agency, and desired the agency (rather than the
courts) to possess whatever degree of discretion the ambiguity
allows.” Smiley v. Citibank (South Dakota),
N. A., 517 U.S.
735, 740–741 (1996); see also, e.g., Cuozzo Speed
Technologies, LLC v. Lee, 579 U.S. 261, 276–277 (2016);
Utility Air Regulatory Group v. EPA, 573 U.S.
302, 315 (2014); National Cable & Telecommunications
Assn. v. Brand X Internet Services, 545 U.S.
967, 982 (2005).

															B

															Neither Chevron nor any subsequent
decision of this Court attempted to reconcile its framework with
the APA. The “law of deference” that this Court has built on the
foundation laid in Chevron has instead been “[h]eedless of
the original design” of the APA. Perez, 575 U. S., at
109 (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment).

															1

															Chevron defies the command of the APA
that “the reviewing court”—not the agency whose action it
reviews—is to “decide all relevant questions of law” and
“interpret . . . statutory provisions.” §706 (emphasis
added). It requires a court to ignore, not follow, “the
reading the court would have reached” had it exercised its
independent judgment as required by the APA. Chevron, 467
U. S., at 843, n. 11. And although exercising independent
judgment is consistent with the “respect” historically given to
Executive Branch interpretations, see, e.g., Edwards’
Lessee, 12 Wheat., at 210; Skidmore, 323 U. S., at
140, Chevron insists on much more. It demands that courts
mechanically afford binding deference to agency
interpretations, including those that have been inconsistent over
time. See 467 U. S., at 863. Still worse, it forces courts to
do so even when a pre-existing judicial precedent holds that the
statute means something else—unless the prior court happened to
also say that the statute is “unambiguous.” Brand X, 545
U. S., at 982. That regime is the antithesis of the time
honored approach the APA prescribes. In fretting over the prospect
of “allow[ing]” a judicial interpretation of a statute “to override
an agency’s” in a dispute before a court, ibid.,
Chevron turns the statutory scheme for judicial review of
agency action upside down.

															Chevron cannot be reconciled with the
APA, as the Government and the dissent contend, by presuming that
statutory ambiguities are implicit delegations to agencies. See
Brief for Respondents in No. 22–1219, pp. 13, 37–38;
post, at 4–15 (opinion of Kagan, J.). Presumptions have
their place in statutory interpretation, but only to the extent
that they approximate reality. Chevron’s presumption does
not, because “[a]n ambiguity is simply not a delegation of
law-interpreting power. Chevron confuses the two.” C.
Sunstein, Interpreting Statutes in the Regulatory State, 103 Harv.
L. Rev. 405, 445 (1989). As Chevron itself noted,
ambiguities may result from an inability on the part of Congress to
squarely answer the question at hand, or from a failure to even
“consider the question” with the requisite precision. 467
U. S., at 865. In neither case does an ambiguity necessarily
reflect a congressional intent that an agency, as opposed to a
court, resolve the resulting interpretive question. And many or
perhaps most statutory ambiguities may be unintentional. As the
Framers recognized, ambiguities will inevitably follow from “the
complexity of objects, . . . the imperfection of the
human faculties,” and the simple fact that “no language is so
copious as to supply words and phrases for every complex idea.” The
Federalist No. 37, at 236.

															Courts, after all, routinely confront statutory
ambiguities in cases having nothing to do with Chevron—cases
that do not involve agency interpretations or delegations of
authority. Of course, when faced with a statutory ambiguity in such
a case, the ambiguity is not a delegation to anybody, and a court
is not somehow relieved of its obligation to independently
interpret the statute. Courts in that situation do not throw up
their hands because “Congress’s instructions have” supposedly “run
out,” leaving a statutory “gap.” Post, at 2 (opinion of
Kagan, J.). Courts instead understand that such statutes, no matter
how impenetrable, do—in fact, must—have a single, best meaning.
That is the whole point of having written statutes; “every
statute’s meaning is fixed at the time of enactment.” Wisconsin
Central Ltd. v. United States, 585 U.S. 274, 284 (2018)
(emphasis deleted). So instead of declaring a particular party’s
reading “permissible” in such a case, courts use every tool at
their disposal to determine the best reading of the statute and
resolve the ambiguity.

															In an agency case as in any other, though, even
if some judges might (or might not) consider the statute ambiguous,
there is a best reading all the same—“the reading the court would
have reached” if no agency were involved. Chevron, 467
U. S., at 843, n. 11. It therefore makes no sense to
speak of a “permissible” interpretation that is not the one the
court, after applying all relevant interpretive tools, concludes is
best. In the business of statutory interpretation, if it is not the
best, it is not permissible.

															Perhaps most fundamentally, Chevron’s
presumption is misguided because agencies have no special
competence in resolving statutory ambiguities. Courts do. The
Framers, as noted, anticipated that courts would often confront
statutory ambiguities and expected that courts would resolve them
by exercising independent legal judgment. And even Chevron
itself reaffirmed that “[t]he judiciary is the final authority on
issues of statutory construction” and recognized that “in the
absence of an administrative interpretation,” it is “necessary” for
a court to “impose its own construction on the statute.”
Id., at 843, and n. 9. Chevron gravely erred,
though, in concluding that the inquiry is fundamentally different
just because an administrative interpretation is in play. The very
point of the traditional tools of statutory construction—the tools
courts use every day—is to resolve statutory ambiguities. That is
no less true when the ambiguity is about the scope of an agency’s
own power—perhaps the occasion on which abdication in favor of the
agency is least appropriate.

															2

															The Government responds that Congress must
generally intend for agencies to resolve statutory ambiguities
because agencies have subject matter expertise regarding the
statutes they administer; because deferring to agencies purportedly
promotes the uniform construction of federal law; and because
resolving statutory ambiguities can involve policymaking best left
to political actors, rather than courts. See Brief for Respondents
in No. 22–1219, pp. 16–19. The dissent offers more of the
same. See post, at 9–14. But none of these considerations
justifies Chevron’s sweeping presumption of congressional
intent.

															Beginning with expertise, we recently noted that
interpretive issues arising in connection with a regulatory scheme
often “may fall more naturally into a judge’s bailiwick” than an
agency’s. Kisor, 588 U. S., at 578 (opinion of the
Court). We thus observed that “[w]hen the agency has no comparative
expertise in resolving a regulatory ambiguity, Congress presumably
would not grant it that authority.” Ibid. Chevron’s
broad rule of deference, though, demands that courts presume just
the opposite. Under that rule, ambiguities of all stripes trigger
deference. Indeed, the Government and, seemingly, the dissent
continue to defend the proposition that Chevron applies even
in cases having little to do with an agency’s technical subject
matter expertise. See Brief for Respondents in No. 22–1219,
p. 17; post, at 10.

															But even when an ambiguity happens to implicate
a technical matter, it does not follow that Congress has taken the
power to authoritatively interpret the statute from the courts and
given it to the agency. Congress expects courts to handle technical
statutory questions. “[M]any statutory cases” call upon “courts
[to] interpret the mass of technical detail that is the ordinary
diet of the law,” Egelhoff v. Egelhoff, 532 U.S.
141, 161 (2001) (Breyer, J., dissenting), and courts did so
without issue in agency cases before Chevron, see
post, at 30 (Gorsuch, J., concurring). Courts, after all, do
not decide such questions blindly. The parties and amici in
such cases are steeped in the subject matter, and reviewing courts
have the benefit of their perspectives. In an agency case in
particular, the court will go about its task with the agency’s
“body of experience and informed judgment,” among other
information, at its disposal. Skidmore, 323 U. S., at
140. And although an agency’s interpretation of a statute “cannot
bind a court,” it may be especially informative “to the extent it
rests on factual premises within [the agency’s] expertise.”
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms v. FLRA,
464 U.S.
89, 98, n. 8 (1983). Such expertise has always been one of
the factors which may give an Executive Branch interpretation
particular “power to persuade, if lacking power to control.”
Skidmore, 323 U. S., at 140; see, e.g.,
County of Maui v. Hawaii Wildlife Fund, 590 U.S. 165,
180 (2020); Moore, 95 U. S., at 763.

															For those reasons, delegating ultimate
interpretive authority to agencies is simply not necessary to
ensure that the resolution of statutory ambiguities is well
informed by subject matter expertise. The better presumption is
therefore that Congress expects courts to do their ordinary job of
interpreting statutes, with due respect for the views of the
Executive Branch. And to the extent that Congress and the Executive
Branch may disagree with how the courts have performed that job in
a particular case, they are of course always free to act by
revising the statute.

															Nor does a desire for the uniform construction
of federal law justify Chevron. Given inconsistencies in how
judges apply Chevron, see infra, at 30–33, it is
unclear how much the doctrine as a whole (as opposed to its highly
deferential second step) actually promotes such uniformity. In any
event, there is little value in imposing a uniform interpretation
of a statute if that interpretation is wrong. We see no reason to
presume that Congress prefers uniformity for uniformity’s sake over
the correct interpretation of the laws it enacts.

															The view that interpretation of ambiguous
statutory provisions amounts to policymaking suited for political
actors rather than courts is especially mistaken, for it rests on a
profound misconception of the judicial role. It is reasonable to
assume that Congress intends to leave policymaking to political
actors. But resolution of statutory ambiguities involves legal
interpretation. That task does not suddenly become policymaking
just because a court has an “agency to fall back on.” Kisor,
588 U. S., at 575 (opinion of the Court). Courts interpret
statutes, no matter the context, based on the traditional tools of
statutory construction, not individual policy preferences. Indeed,
the Framers crafted the Constitution to ensure that federal judges
could exercise judgment free from the influence of the political
branches. See The Federalist, No. 78, at 522–525. They were to
construe the law with “[c]lear heads . . . and honest
hearts,” not with an eye to policy preferences that had not made it
into the statute. 1 Works of James Wilson 363 (J. Andrews ed.
1896).

															That is not to say that Congress cannot or does
not confer discretionary authority on agencies. Congress may do so,
subject to constitutional limits, and it often has. But to stay out
of discretionary policymaking left to the political branches,
judges need only fulfill their obligations under the APA to
independently identify and respect such delegations of authority,
police the outer statutory boundaries of those delegations, and
ensure that agencies exercise their discretion consistent with the
APA. By forcing courts to instead pretend that ambiguities are
necessarily delegations, Chevron does not prevent judges
from making policy. It prevents them from judging.

															3

															In truth, Chevron’s justifying
presumption is, as Members of this Court have often recognized, a
fiction. See Buffington v. McDonough, 598 U. S.
___, ___ (2022) (Gorsuch, J., dissenting from denial of certiorari)
(slip op., at 11); Cuozzo, 579 U. S., at 286 (Thomas,
J., concurring); Scalia, 1989 Duke L. J., at 517; see also
post, at 15 (opinion of Kagan, J.). So we have spent the
better part of four decades imposing one limitation on
Chevron after another, pruning its presumption on the
understanding that “where it is in doubt that Congress actually
intended to delegate particular interpretive authority to an
agency, Chevron is ‘inapplicable.’ ” United
States v. Mead Corp., 533 U.S.
218, 230 (2001) (quoting Christensen v. Harris
County, 529 U.S.
576, 597 (2000) (Breyer, J., dissenting)); see also Adams
Fruit Co. v. Barrett, 494 U.S.
638, 649 (1990).

															Consider the many refinements we have made in an
effort to match Chevron’s presumption to reality. We have
said that Chevron applies only “when it appears that
Congress delegated authority to the agency generally to make rules
carrying the force of law, and that the agency interpretation
claiming deference was promulgated in the exercise of that
authority.” Mead, 533 U. S., at 226–227. In practice,
that threshold requirement—sometimes called Chevron “step
zero”—largely limits Chevron to “the fruits of
notice-and-comment rulemaking or formal adjudication.” 533
U. S., at 230. But even when those processes are used,
deference is still not warranted “where the regulation is
‘procedurally defective’—that is, where the agency errs by failing
to follow the correct procedures in issuing the regulation.”
Encino Motorcars, LLC v. Navarro, 579 U.S. 211, 220
(2016) (quoting Mead, 533 U. S., at 227).

															Even where those procedural hurdles are cleared,
substantive ones remain. Most notably, Chevron does not
apply if the question at issue is one of “deep ‘economic and
political significance.’ ” King v. Burwell,
576 U.S.
473, 486 (2015). We have instead expected Congress to delegate
such authority “expressly” if at all, ibid., for
“[e]xtraordinary grants of regulatory authority are rarely
accomplished through ‘modest words,’ ‘vague terms,’ or ‘subtle
device[s],’ ” West Virginia v. EPA, 597 U.S.
697, 723 (2022) (quoting Whitman v. American Trucking
Assns., Inc., 531 U.S.
457, 468 (2001); alteration in original). Nor have we applied
Chevron to agency interpretations of judicial review
provisions, see Adams Fruit Co., 494 U. S., at 649–650,
or to statutory schemes not administered by the agency seeking
deference, see Epic Systems Corp. v. Lewis, 584 U.S.
497, 519–520 (2018). And we have sent mixed signals on whether
Chevron applies when a statute has criminal applications.
Compare Abramski v. United States, 573 U.S.
169, 191 (2014), with Babbitt v. Sweet Home Chapter,
Communities for Great Ore., 515 U.S.
687, 704, n. 18 (1995).

															Confronted with this byzantine set of
preconditions and exceptions, some courts have simply bypassed
Chevron, saying it makes no difference for one reason or
another.[7] And even when they
do invoke Chevron, courts do not always heed the various
steps and nuances of that evolving doctrine. In one of the cases
before us today, for example, the First Circuit both skipped “step
zero,” see 62 F. 4th, at 628, and refused to “classify [its]
conclusion as a product of Chevron step one or step
two”—though it ultimately appears to have deferred under step two,
id., at 634.

															This Court, for its part, has not deferred to an
agency interpretation under Chevron since 2016. See
Cuozzo, 579 U. S., at 280 (most recent occasion). But
Chevron remains on the books. So litigants must continue to
wrestle with it, and lower courts—bound by even our crumbling
precedents, see Agostini v. Felton, 521 U.S.
203, 238 (1997)—understandably continue to apply it.

															The experience of the last 40 years has thus
done little to rehabilitate Chevron. It has only made clear
that Chevron’s fictional presumption of congressional intent
was always unmoored from the APA’s demand that courts exercise
independent judgment in construing statutes administered by
agencies. At best, our intricate Chevron doctrine has been
nothing more than a distraction from the question that matters:
Does the statute authorize the challenged agency action? And at
worst, it has required courts to violate the APA by yielding to an
agency the express responsibility, vested in “the reviewing
court,” to “decide all relevant questions of law” and
“interpret . . . statutory provisions.” §706 (emphasis
added).

															IV

															The only question left is whether stare
decisis, the doctrine governing judicial adherence to
precedent, requires us to persist in the Chevron project. It
does not. Stare decisis is not an “inexorable command,”
Payne v. Tennessee, 501 U.S.
808, 828 (1991), and the stare decisis considerations
most relevant here—“the quality of [the precedent’s] reasoning, the
workability of the rule it established, . . . and
reliance on the decision,” Knick v. Township of
Scott, 588 U.S. 180, 203 (2019) (quoting Janus v.
State, County, and Municipal Employees, 585 U.S. 878, 917
(2018))—all weigh in favor of letting Chevron go.

															Chevron has proved to be fundamentally
misguided. Despite reshaping judicial review of agency action,
neither it nor any case of ours applying it grappled with the
APA—the statute that lays out how such review works. Its flaws were
nonetheless apparent from the start, prompting this Court to revise
its foundations and continually limit its application. It has
launched and sustained a cottage industry of scholars attempting to
decipher its basis and meaning. And Members of this Court have long
questioned its premises. See, e.g., Pereira v.
Sessions, 585 U.S. 198, 219–221 (2018) (Kennedy, J.,
concurring); Michigan, 576 U. S., at 760–764
(Thomas, J., concurring); Buffington, 598 U. S.
___ (opinion of Gorsuch, J.); B. Kavanaugh, Fixing Statutory
Interpretation, 129 Harv. L. Rev. 2118, 2150–2154 (2016). Even
Justice Scalia, an early champion of Chevron, came to
seriously doubt whether it could be reconciled with the APA. See
Perez, 575 U. S., at 109–110 (opinion concurring in
judgment). For its entire existence, Chevron has been a
“rule in search of a justification,” Knick, 588 U. S.,
at 204, if it was ever coherent enough to be called a rule at
all.

															Experience has also shown that Chevron is
unworkable. The defining feature of its framework is the
identification of statutory ambiguity, which requires deference at
the doctrine’s second step. But the concept of ambiguity has always
evaded meaningful definition. As Justice Scalia put the dilemma
just five years after Chevron was decided: “How clear is
clear?” 1989 Duke L. J., at 521.

															We are no closer to an answer to that question
than we were four decades ago. “ ‘[A]mbiguity’ is a term that
may have different meanings for different judges.” Exxon Mobil
Corp. v. Allapattah Services, Inc., 545 U.S.
546, 572 (2005) (Stevens, J., dissenting). One judge might see
ambiguity everywhere; another might never encounter it. Compare L.
Silberman, Chevron—The Intersection of Law & Policy, 58 Geo.
Wash. L. Rev. 821, 822 (1990), with R. Kethledge, Ambiguities
and Agency Cases: Reflections After (Almost) Ten Years on the
Bench, 70 Vand. L. Rev. En Banc 315, 323 (2017). A rule of law
that is so wholly “in the eye of the beholder,” Exxon Mobil
Corp., 545 U. S., at 572 (Stevens, J., dissenting),
invites different results in like cases and is therefore “arbitrary
in practice,” Gulfstream Aerospace Corp. v. Mayacamas
Corp., 485 U.S.
271, 283 (1988). Such an impressionistic and malleable concept
“cannot stand as an every-day test for allocating” interpretive
authority between courts and agencies. Swift & Co. v.
Wickham, 382 U.S.
111, 125 (1965).

															The dissent proves the point. It tells us that a
court should reach Chevron’s second step when it finds, “at
the end of its interpretive work,” that “Congress has left an
ambiguity or gap.” Post, at 1–2. (The Government offers a
similar test. See Brief for Respondents in No. 22–1219, pp. 7,
10, 14; Tr. of Oral Arg. 113–114, 116.) That is no guide at all.
Once more, the basic nature and meaning of a statute does not
change when an agency happens to be involved. Nor does it change
just because the agency has happened to offer its interpretation
through the sort of procedures necessary to obtain deference, or
because the other preconditions for Chevron happen to be
satisfied. The statute still has a best meaning, necessarily
discernible by a court deploying its full interpretive toolkit. So
for the dissent’s test to have any meaning, it must think that in
an agency case (unlike in any other), a court should give up on its
“interpretive work” before it has identified that best meaning. But
how does a court know when to do so? On that point, the dissent
leaves a gap of its own. It protests only that some other
interpretive tools—all with pedigrees more robust than
Chevron’s, and all designed to help courts identify the
meaning of a text rather than allow the Executive Branch to
displace it—also apply to ambiguous texts. See post, at 27.
That this is all the dissent can come up with, after four decades
of judicial experience attempting to identify ambiguity under
Chevron, reveals the futility of the exercise.[8]

															Because Chevron in its original, two-step
form was so indeterminate and sweeping, we have instead been forced
to clarify the doctrine again and again. Our attempts to do so have
only added to Chevron’s unworkability, transforming the
original two-step into a dizzying breakdance. See Adams Fruit
Co., 494 U. S., at 649–650; Mead, 533 U. S.,
at 226–227; King, 576 U. S., at 486; Encino
Motorcars, 579 U. S., at 220; Epic Systems, 584
U. S., at 519–520; on and on. And the doctrine continues to
spawn difficult threshold questions that promise to further
complicate the inquiry should Chevron be retained. See,
e.g., Cargill v. Garland, 57 F. 4th
447, 465–468 (CA5 2023) (plurality opinion) (May the Government
waive reliance on Chevron? Does Chevron apply to
agency interpretations of statutes imposing criminal penalties?
Does Chevron displace the rule of lenity?), aff ’d, 602
U. S. ___ (2024).

															Four decades after its inception, Chevron
has thus become an impediment, rather than an aid, to accomplishing
the basic judicial task of “say[ing] what the law is.”
Marbury, 1 Cranch, at 177. And its continuing import is far
from clear. Courts have often declined to engage with the doctrine,
saying it makes no difference. See n. 7, supra. And as
noted, we have avoided deferring under Chevron since 2016.
That trend is nothing new; for decades, we have often declined to
invoke Chevron even in those cases where it might appear to
be applicable. See W. Eskridge & L. Baer, The Continuum of
Deference: Supreme Court Treatment of Agency Statutory
Interpretations From Chevron to Hamdan, 96 Geo.
L. J. 1083, 1125 (2008). At this point, all that remains of
Chevron is a decaying husk with bold pretensions.

															Nor has Chevron been the sort of
“ ‘stable background’ rule” that fosters meaningful reliance.
Post, at 8, n. 1 (opinion of Kagan, J.) (quoting
Morrison v. National Australia Bank Ltd., 561 U.S.
247, 261 (2010)). Given our constant tinkering with and
eventual turn away from Chevron, and its inconsistent
application by the lower courts, it instead is hard to see how
anyone—Congress included—could reasonably expect a court to rely on
Chevron in any particular case. And even if it were possible
to predict accurately when courts will apply Chevron, the
doctrine “does not provide ‘a clear or easily applicable standard,
so arguments for reliance based on its clarity are
misplaced.’ ” Janus, 585 U. S., at 927 (quoting
South Dakota v. Wayfair, Inc., 585 U.S. 162, 186
(2018)). To plan on Chevron yielding a particular result is
to gamble not only that the doctrine will be invoked, but also that
it will produce readily foreseeable outcomes and the stability that
comes with them. History has proved neither bet to be a winning
proposition.

															Rather than safeguarding reliance interests,
Chevron affirmatively destroys them. Under Chevron, a
statutory ambiguity, no matter why it is there, becomes a license
authorizing an agency to change positions as much as it likes, with
“[u]nexplained inconsistency” being “at most . . . a
reason for holding an interpretation to be . . .
arbitrary and capricious.” Brand X, 545 U. S., at 981.
But statutory ambiguity, as we have explained, is not a reliable
indicator of actual delegation of discretionary authority to
agencies. Chevron thus allows agencies to change course even
when Congress has given them no power to do so. By its sheer
breadth, Chevron fosters unwarranted instability in the law,
leaving those attempting to plan around agency action in an eternal
fog of uncertainty.

															Chevron accordingly has undermined the
very “rule of law” values that stare decisis exists to
secure. Michigan v. Bay Mills Indian Community,
572 U.S.
782, 798 (2014). And it cannot be constrained by admonishing
courts to be extra careful, or by tacking on a new batch of
conditions. We would need to once again “revis[e] its theoretical
basis . . . in order to cure its practical deficiencies.”
Montejo v. Louisiana, 556 U.S.
778, 792 (2009). Stare decisis does not require us to do
so, especially because any refinements we might make would only
point courts back to their duties under the APA to “decide all
relevant questions of law” and “interpret . . . statutory
provisions.” §706. Nor is there any reason to wait helplessly for
Congress to correct our mistake. The Court has jettisoned many
precedents that Congress likewise could have legislatively
overruled. See, e.g., Patterson v. McLean Credit
Union, 485 U.S.
617, 618 (1988) (per curiam) (collecting cases). And
part of “judicial humility,” post, at 3, 25 (opinion of
Kagan, J.,), is admitting and in certain cases correcting our own
mistakes, especially when those mistakes are serious, see
post, at 8–9 (opinion of Gorsuch, J.).

															This is one of those cases. Chevron was a
judicial invention that required judges to disregard their
statutory duties. And the only way to “ensure that the law will not
merely change erratically, but will develop in a principled and
intelligible fashion,” Vasquez v. Hillery, 474 U.S.
254, 265 (1986), is for us to leave Chevron behind.

															By doing so, however, we do not call into
question prior cases that relied on the Chevron framework.
The holdings of those cases that specific agency actions are
lawful—including the Clean Air Act holding of Chevron
itself—are still subject to statutory stare decisis despite
our change in interpretive methodology. See CBOCS West, Inc.
v. Humphries, 553 U.S.
442, 457 (2008). Mere reliance on Chevron cannot
constitute a “ ‘special justification’ ” for overruling
such a holding, because to say a precedent relied on Chevron
is, at best, “just an argument that the precedent was wrongly
decided.” Halliburton Co. v. Erica P. John Fund,
Inc., 573 U.S.
258, 266 (2014) (quoting Dickerson v. United
States, 530 U.S.
428, 443 (2000)). That is not enough to justify overruling a
statutory precedent.

															*  *  *

															The dissent ends by quoting Chevron:
“ ‘Judges are not experts in the field.’ ” Post,
at 31 (quoting 467 U. S., at 865). That depends, of course, on
what the “field” is. If it is legal interpretation, that has been,
“emphatically,” “the province and duty of the judicial department”
for at least 221 years. Marbury, 1 Cranch, at 177. The rest
of the dissent’s selected epigraph is that judges “ ‘are not
part of either political branch.’ ” Post, at 31
(quoting Chevron, 467 U. S., at 865). Indeed. Judges
have always been expected to apply their “judgment”
independent of the political branches when interpreting the
laws those branches enact. The Federalist No. 78, at 523. And one
of those laws, the APA, bars judges from disregarding that
responsibility just because an Executive Branch agency views a
statute differently.

															Chevron is overruled. Courts must
exercise their independent judgment in deciding whether an agency
has acted within its statutory authority, as the APA requires.
Careful attention to the judgment of the Executive Branch may help
inform that inquiry. And when a particular statute delegates
authority to an agency consistent with constitutional limits,
courts must respect the delegation, while ensuring that the agency
acts within it. But courts need not and under the APA may not defer
to an agency interpretation of the law simply because a statute is
ambiguous.

															Because the D. C. and First Circuits relied
on Chevron in deciding whether to uphold the Rule, their
judgments are vacated, and the cases are remanded for further
proceedings consistent with this opinion.

															

															It is so ordered.

presented questions regarding the consistency of the Rule with the
MSA. See Pet. for Cert. in No. 22–451, p. i; Pet. for Cert. in

to those questions and thus do not reach them.

 The dissent plucks out
Gray, Hearst, and—to “gild the lily,” in its
telling—three more 1940s decisions, claiming they reflect the
relevant historical tradition of judicial review. Post, at
21–22, and n. 6 (opinion of Kagan, J.). But it has no
substantial response to the fact that Gray and Hearst
themselves endorsed, implicitly in one case and explicitly in the
next, the traditional rule that “questions of statutory
interpretation . . . are for the courts to resolve,
giving appropriate weight”—not outright deference—“to the judgment
of those whose special duty is to administer the questioned
statute.” Hearst, 322 U. S., at 130–131. And it fails
to recognize the deep roots that this rule has in our Nation’s
judicial tradition, to the limited extent it engages with that
tradition at all. See post, at 20–21, n. 5. Instead,
like the Government, it strains to equate the “respect” or “weight”
traditionally afforded to Executive Branch interpretations with
binding deference. See ibid.; Brief for Respondents in No.
22–1219, pp. 21–24. That supposed equivalence is a fiction.
The dissent’s cases establish that a “contemporaneous
construction” shared by “not only . . . the
courts” but also “the departments” could be “controlling,”
Schell’s Executors v. Fauché, 138
U.S. 562, 572 (1891) (emphasis added), and that courts might
“lean in favor” of a “contemporaneous” and “continued” construction
of the Executive Branch as strong evidence of a statute’s meaning,
United States v. Alabama Great Southern R. Co.,
142 U.S.
615, 621 (1892). They do not establish that Executive Branch
interpretations of ambiguous statutes—no matter how inconsistent,
late breaking, or flawed—always bound the courts. In
reality, a judge was never “bound to adopt the construction given
by the head of a department.” Decatur v. Paulding, 14
Pet. 497, 515 (1840).

 The dissent observes that
Section 706 does not say expressly that courts are to decide legal
questions using “a de novo standard of review.”
Post, at 16. That much is true. But statutes can be sensibly
understood only “by reviewing text in context.” Pulsifer v.
United States, 601 U.S. 124, 133 (2024). Since the start of
our Republic, courts have “decide[d] . . . questions of
law” and “interpret[ed] constitutional and statutory provisions” by
applying their own legal judgment. §706. Setting aside its
misplaced reliance on Gray and Hearst, the dissent
does not and could not deny that tradition. But it nonetheless
insists that to codify that tradition, Congress needed to expressly
reject a sort of deference the courts had never before applied—and
would not apply for several decades to come. It did not. “The
notion that some things ‘go without saying’ applies to legislation
just as it does to everyday life.” Bond v. United
States, 572 U.S.
844, 857 (2014).

 Citing an empirical
study, the dissent adds that Chevron “fosters
agreement among judges.” Post, at 28. It is hardly
surprising that a study might find as much; Chevron’s second
step is supposed to be hospitable to agency interpretations. So
when judges get there, they tend to agree that the agency wins.
That proves nothing about the supposed ease or predictability of
identifying ambiguity in the first place.
