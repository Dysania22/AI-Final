															SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

															CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION BUREAU, et al.,
PETITIONERS v. COMMUNITY FINANCIAL SERVICES ASSOCIATION OF
AMERICA, LIMITED, et al.

															on writ of certiorari to the united states
court of appeals for the fifth circuit

															[May 16, 2024]

															

															Justice Jackson, concurring.

															Today, the Court correctly concludes that, based
on the plain meaning of the text of the Appropriations Clause, “an
appropriation is simply a law that authorizes expenditures from a
specified source of public money for designated purposes.”
Ante, at 5. The statute that Congress passed to fund the
Consumer Financial Protection Bureau easily meets the
Appropriations Clause’s minimal requirements. See ante, at
15. It authorizes the Bureau to withdraw money from “the combined
earnings of the Federal Reserve System,” 12 U. S. C.
§5497(a)(1), in order “to pay the expenses of the Bureau in
carrying out its duties and responsibilities,” §5497(c)(1). In my
view, nothing more is needed to decide this case.

															Indeed, there are good reasons to go no further.
When the Constitution’s text does not provide a limit to a
coordinate branch’s power, we should not lightly assume that
Article III implicitly directs the Judiciary to find one. The
Constitution was “intended to endure for ages to come, and,
consequently, to be adapted to the various crises of human
affairs.” McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 415
(1819) (emphasis deleted). An essential aspect of the
Constitution’s endurance is that it empowers the political branches
to address new challenges by enacting new laws and policies—without
undue interference by courts. To that end, we have made clear in
cases too numerous to count that nothing in the Constitution gives
federal courts “ ‘some amorphous general supervision of the
operations of government.’ ” Raines v. Byrd,
521 U.S.
811, 829 (1997) (quoting United States v.
Richardson, 418 U.S.
166, 192 (1974) (Powell, J., concurring)). Put another way, the
principle of separation of powers manifested in the Constitution’s
text applies with just as much force to the Judiciary as it does to
Congress and the Executive. See Public Workers v.
Mitchell, 330 U.S.
75, 90–91 (1947).

															This case illustrates why. As the Court
explains, in response to the devastation wrought by the 2008
financial crisis, Congress passed and the President signed the
Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. See
ante, at 2. In that statute, Congress chose to fund the
Bureau outside of the annual appropriations process. See
ante, at 3. Drawing on its extensive experience in financial
regulation, Congress designed the funding scheme to protect the
Bureau from the risk that powerful regulated entities might capture
the annual appropriations process. See, e.g.,
S. Rep. No. 111–176, pp. 162–164 (2010); A. Levitin, The
Politics of Financial Regulation and the Regulation of Financial
Politics, 127 Harv. L. Rev. 1991, 2056–2058 (2014); R. Barkow,
Insulating Agencies, 89 Texas L. Rev. 15, 42–45, 67, 77
(2010); see also ante, at 4 (Kagan, J., concurring)
(describing long history of congressional flexibility in designing
funding schemes for financial regulators).

															Respondents, two associations of payday lenders,
represent exactly the type of entity the Bureau’s progenitors
sought to regulate and whose influence Congress may have feared.
See O. Bar-Gill & E. Warren, Making Credit Safer, 157 U. Pa.
L. Rev. 1, 44–45, 55–59, 68–70 (2008). In urging us to find
the Bureau’s funding scheme unconstitutional, then, respondents
would not only have us find unstated limits in the Constitution’s
text, they would have us undercut the considered judgments of a
coordinate branch about how to respond to a pressing national
concern.

															Of course, to say that Congress had reasons for
designing the Bureau’s funding scheme in the manner it did is not
to endorse those policy choices. “With the wisdom of the policy
adopted, with the adequacy or practicability of the law enacted to
forward it, the courts are both incompetent and unauthorized to
deal.” Nebbia v. New York, 291
U.S. 502, 537 (1934). Instead, the Constitution places primary
responsibility for checking the political branches with the People.
See King v. Burwell, 576 U.S.
473, 498 (2015) (“In a democracy, the power to make the law
rests with those chosen by the people”). It is to them that the
Court rightly returns any remaining policy questions posed by
today’s case.
