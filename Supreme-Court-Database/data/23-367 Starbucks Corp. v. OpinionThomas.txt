															Starbucks Corporation, PETITIONER v. M.
Kathleen McKinney, Regional Di- rector of region 15 of the Nation-
al Labor Relations Board, for and on behalf of the National Labor
Relations Board

															on writ of certiorari to the united states
court of appeals for the sixth circuit

															[June 13, 2024]

															

															Justice Thomas delivered the opinion of the
Court.

															The National Labor Relations Board can bring
in-house enforcement proceedings against employers and labor unions
for engaging in unfair labor practices. Section 10( j) of the
National Labor Relations Act authorizes the Board to seek a
preliminary injunction from a federal district court while these
administrative enforcement proceedings take place. The question in
this case is whether the traditional four-factor test for a
preliminary injunction articulated in Winter v. Natural
Resources Defense Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7
(2008), governs the Board’s requests under §10( j). We
conclude that it does, and therefore vacate and remand.

															I

															A

															The National Labor Relations Act (NLRA)
prohibits employers and unions from engaging in certain “unfair
labor practice[s].” 49Stat. 452, 29 U. S. C. §§158(a),
(b). The National Labor Relations Board enforces that prohibition.
§160(a). The Board’s “authority kicks in when a person files a
charge with the agency alleging that” an employer or labor union
has engaged in an unfair labor practice. Glacier Northwest,
Inc. v. Teamsters, 598 U.S. 771, 775 (2023) (citing 29
CFR §101.2 (2021)). A regional Director then investigates the
charge. §101.4 (2023). And, “[i]f the charge appears to have
merit,” the director institutes a formal action against the
offending party by issuing an administrative complaint. §101.8.
This complaint triggers adjudicatory proceedings within the agency,
first before an administrative law judge, and then before the Board
itself. See 29 U. S. C. §§160(b), (c); 29 CFR §§101.10 to
101.12. A federal court of appeals may review the Board’s final
order, if an aggrieved party seeks judicial review or if the Board
seeks enforcement of its order. 29 U. S. C.
§§160(e)–(f ). On review, the Board’s findings of fact are
“conclusive” “if supported by substantial evidence.”
Ibid.

															Because the Board’s administrative proceedings
take years, Congress vested the Board with authority to seek a
preliminary injunction in federal court while the proceedings
unfold. Section 10( j) of the NLRA provides that, “upon
issuance of a complaint,” the Board may “petition any United States
district court . . . for appropriate temporary relief.”
§160( j). A district court considering a §10( j) petition
may “grant to the Board such temporary relief . . . as it
deems just and proper.” Ibid.

															B

															Starbucks is the world’s largest coffeehouse
chain, with over 34,000 locations. In 2022, six employees at a
Memphis, Tennessee, location announced plans to unionize the store
and formed an organizing committee. Several employees, including
some members of the organizing committee, invited a news crew from
a local television station to visit the store after hours to
promote their unionizing effort. The news crew interviewed the
employees about their reasons for organizing and what they hoped to
achieve. The next day, store management learned about the media
event and launched an investigation. Starbucks ultimately fired
multiple employees involved with the media event for violating
company policy. These included the members of the organizing
committee who were in attendance. The union coordinating with the
employees filed charges with the Board. The union alleged that
Starbucks unlawfully interfered with the employees’ right to
unionize and discriminated against union supporters, in violation
of 29 U. S. C. §§158(a)(1) and (3). After investigating
the allegations, the Board issued a complaint against Starbucks.
The regional Director then filed a §10( j) petition in the
United States District Court for the Western District of Tennessee,
seeking a preliminary injunction that would, among other things,
require Starbucks to reinstate the fired employees.

															To assess whether the Board was entitled to a
preliminary injunction under §10( j), the District Court
applied the two-part test established by Sixth Circuit precedent.
That test asks whether “there is reasonable cause to believe that
unfair labor practices have occurred,” and whether injunctive
relief is “just and proper.” McKinney v. Ozburn-Hessey
Logistics, LLC, 875 F.3d 333, 339 (2017) (internal quotation
marks omitted). The Board could establish reasonable cause by
simply showing that its “legal theory [was] substantial and not
frivolous.” Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted). And,
relief would be just and proper if it were “necessary to return the
parties to [the] status quo pending the Board’s proceedings in
order to protect the Board’s remedial powers under the NLRA.”
Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted). Applying this
standard, the District Court granted an injunction to the Board.
2022 WL 5434206, *12 (WD Tenn., Aug. 18, 2022). And, applying
Circuit precedent, the Sixth Circuit affirmed. 77 F. 4th 391,
400–401 (2023).[1]*

															Not all courts evaluate petitions for
§10( j) injunctions under the standard applied by the Sixth
Circuit. Some courts instead apply the four-part test for
preliminary injunctions articulated in Winter v. Natural
Resources Defense Council, Inc., 555 U.S.
7. See, e.g., Hooks v. Nexstar
Broadcasting, Inc., 54 F. 4th 1101, 1114 (CA9 2022);
McKinney v. Southern Bakeries, LLC, 786 F.3d 1119,
1122 (CA8 2015); Muffley v. Spartan Mining Co., 570
F.3d 534, 542–543 (CA4 2009); Bloedorn v. Francisco
Foods, Inc.¸ 
276 F.3d 270, 286 (CA7 2001). That familiar standard requires a
plaintiff to make a clear showing that “he is likely to succeed on
the merits, that he is likely to suffer irreparable harm in the
absence of preliminary relief, that the balance of equities tips in
his favor, and that an injunction is in the public interest.”
Winter, 555 U. S., at 20, 22. We granted certiorari to
resolve the Circuit split about what standard governs the Board’s
requests for preliminary injunctions under §10( j), 601
U. S. ___ (2024), and now vacate and remand.

															II

															Section 10( j) authorizes a federal
district court “to grant . . . such temporary relief
. . . as it deems just and proper” during the pendency of
the Board’s administrative proceedings. §160( j). When
Congress empowers courts to grant equitable relief, there is a
strong presumption that courts will exercise that authority in a
manner consistent with traditional principles of equity. For
preliminary injunctions, the four criteria identified in
Winter encompass the relevant equitable principles. Nothing
in §10( j) displaces the presumption that those traditional
principles govern. We therefore conclude that district courts must
use the traditional four-part test when evaluating the Board’s
request for a preliminary injunction under §10( j).

															A

															A preliminary injunction is an “extraordinary”
equitable remedy that is “never awarded as of right.”
Winter, 555 U. S., at 24. Its purpose “is merely to
preserve the relative positions of the parties until a trial on the
merits can be held.” University of Tex. v. Camenisch,
451 U.S.
390, 395 (1981). The default rule is that a plaintiff seeking a
preliminary injunction must make a clear showing that “he is likely
to succeed on the merits, that he is likely to suffer irreparable
harm in the absence of preliminary relief, that the balance of
equities tips in his favor, and that an injunction is in the public
interest.” Winter, 555 U. S., at 20, 22. “These
commonplace considerations applicable to cases in which injunctions
are sought in the federal courts reflect a ‘practice with a
background of several hundred years of history.’ ”
Weinberger v. Romero-Barcelo, 456
U.S. 305, 313 (1982) (quoting Hecht Co. v.
Bowles, 321 U.S.
321, 329 (1944)); see also Georgia v. Brailsford,
2 Dall. 402, 406 (1792) (opinion of Iredell, J.); id., at
407 (opinion of Blair, J.).

															When interpreting a statute that authorizes
federal courts to grant preliminary injunctions, “we do not lightly
assume that Congress has intended to depart from established
principles.” Romero-Barcelo, 456 U. S., at 313; see
also Porter v. Warner Holding Co., 328 U.S.
395, 398 (1946). This Court has consistently employed this
presumption when interpreting a wide variety of statutes that
authorize preliminary and permanent injunctions. See,
e.g., United States v. Oakland Cannabis
Buyers’ Cooperative, 532 U.S.
483, 496 (2001) (Controlled Substances Act);
Romero-Barcelo, 456 U. S., at 312–313 (Federal Water
Pollution Control Act); Amoco Production Co. v.
Gambell, 480 U.S.
531, 542–544 (1987) (Alaska National Interest Lands
Conservation Act); Hecht, 321 U. S., at 329 (Emergency
Price Control Act). Thus, absent a clear command from Congress,
courts must adhere to the traditional four-factor test.

															Nothing in §10( j)’s text overcomes the
presumption that the four traditional criteria govern a
preliminary-injunction request by the Board. Section 10( j)
authorizes a district court “to grant to the Board such temporary
relief . . . as it deems just and proper.” We do not
understand the statutory directive to grant relief when the
district court “deems” it “just and proper” to jettison the normal
equitable rules. To the contrary, the phrase “just and proper”
invokes the discretion that courts have traditionally exercised
when faced with requests for equitable relief. As a matter of
ordinary meaning, the word “just” means “fair” and “righteous.”
Funk & Wagnalls New Standard Dictionary 1334 (1942); see also
Webster’s New International Dictionary 1348 (2d ed. 1934)
(“righteous” and “equitable”). And, the word “proper” means
“appropriate,” “suitable,” or “correct.” Id., at 1983.
Crafting “fair” and “appropriate” equitable relief necessitates the
exercise of discretion—the hallmark of traditional equitable
practice. See Hecht, 321 U. S., at 329 (“The essence of
equity jurisdiction has been the power of the Chancellor to do
equity and to mould each decree to the necessities of the
particular case”); see also 77 F. 4th, at 403 (Readler, J.,
concurring); Kinney v. Pioneer Press, 881 F.2d 485,
491 (CA7 1989) (Easterbrook, J.) (“Section 10( j) tells the
district court to do what’s ‘just and proper’, which we read as a
statement that traditional rules govern”).

															This Court’s precedent also counsels against
reading §10( j) to supplant the traditional equitable
principles governing injunctions. In Hecht, the Court
interpreted the Emergency Price Control Act of 1942’s instruction
that an injunction “shall be granted” if the Office of Price
Administration shows that a defendant “has engaged or is about to
engage” in a prohibited act. 321 U. S., at 322 (quoting ch.
26, 56Stat. 23, 50 U. S. C. App. §925 (1940 ed., Supp.
II)). This language is far more favorable to the agency than
§10( j) because it seemingly suggests that courts must
grant injunctive relief where the agency makes the required
showing. Yet, the Court refused to read the Emergency Price Control
Act to create such “a major departure from th[e] long tradition” of
equity. 321 U. S., at 330. The Court reasoned that “if
Congress desired to make such an abrupt departure from traditional
equity practice . . . , it would have made its desire
plain.” Ibid. If the Emergency Price Control Act did not
displace the presumption that traditional equitable principles
apply, then §10( j)’s discretion-inviting directive to grant
injunctive relief as district courts “dee[m] just and proper” does
not either.

															Finally, §10( j)’s text bears no
resemblance to the language that Congress has employed when it has
altered the normal equitable rules. Some statutes increase the
burden for obtaining an injunction. Another provision in the NLRA
itself, for example, makes it harder for the Government to obtain
an injunction against union strikes and lockouts by requiring a
showing that the strike or lockout “affects an entire industry or a
substantial part thereof ” and “imperil[s] the national health
or safety.” 29 U. S. C. §178(a). And, courts evaluating
preliminary-injunction requests under the Prison Litigation Reform
Act must “give substantial weight to any adverse impact on public
safety or the operation of a criminal justice system.” 18
U. S. C. §3626(a)(2). Other statutes expressly relieve
the party moving for an injunction from showing that he can satisfy
one of the traditional criteria. For instance, plaintiffs alleging
trademark violations are entitled to “a rebuttable presumption of
irreparable harm . . . upon a finding of likelihood of
success on the merits.” 132Stat. 2208, 15 U. S. C.
§1116(a). Unlike these statutes, §10( j) omits any specific
instruction that suggests Congress altered the traditional
equitable rules. It simply invites courts to grant equitable relief
where they deem it “just and proper.” And, in exercising this
discretionary authority, courts must “be guided by sound
[equitable] principles.” Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S.
418, 434 (2009) (internal quotation marks omitted).

															In sum, because nothing in §10( j)’s text
overcomes the presumption that traditional equitable principles
govern, district courts considering the Board’s request for a
preliminary injunction must apply the Winter framework,
which embodies those traditional principles.

															B

															Rather than contest that traditional equitable
criteria govern, the Board recasts the dispute as one about how
statutory context informs the application of those criteria. The
Board highlights that Congress made the Board, not federal courts,
responsible for adjudicating charges of unfair labor practices in
the first instance and that courts of appeals must review the
Board’s final decisions deferentially. According to the Board,
these contextual considerations require district courts evaluating
§10( j) petitions to apply the traditional criteria in a less
exacting way, and the Sixth Circuit’s reasonable-cause standard
appropriately accounts for context. The partial dissent also
asserts that “a district court’s preliminary look at the merits” of
a §10(j) petition “should be far less searching than normal” for
similar reasons. Post, at 14 (Jackson, J., concurring
in part, concurring in judgment, and dissenting in part). We
disagree.

															The reasonable-cause standard goes far beyond
simply fine tuning the traditional criteria to the §10( j)
context—it substantively lowers the bar for securing a preliminary
injunction by requiring courts to yield to the Board’s preliminary
view of the facts, law, and equities. Nowhere is this more evident
than with what the Board, as movant, must show about the merits of
its claims. Under the traditional standard, the Board would have to
make a clear showing that it “is likely to succeed on the merits.”
Winter, 555 U. S., at 20. And, in assessing that
likelihood, a district court must evaluate any factual conflicts or
difficult questions of law. 11A C. Wright, A. Miller, & M.
Kane, Federal Practice and Procedure §2948.3 (3d ed. 2013). By
contrast, the Board may obtain a §10( j) injunction under the
reasonable-cause standard by merely showing “reasonable cause to
believe that unfair labor practices have occurred.”
Ozburn-Hessey Logistics, 875 F. 3d, at 339 (internal
quotation marks omitted). The Board “need not convince the court of
the validity of [its] theory of liability, as long as the theory is
substantial and not frivolous.” Gottfried v. Frankel,
818 F.2d 485, 493 (CA6 1987). And, “[i]n reviewing the supporting
facts, a district court may not resolve conflicting evidence or
make credibility determinations.” 77 F. 4th, at 397.

															There is an obvious difference between having
the Board show that it is “likely” to succeed on the merits and
having it show only that its theory of the case is “substantial and
not frivolous,” without having to convince the court that its
theory is likely meritorious. In fact, it is hard to imagine how
the Board could lose under the reasonable-cause test if courts
deferentially ask only whether the Board offered a minimally
plausible legal theory, while ignoring conflicting law or facts. As
Judge Readler explained, if the reasonable-cause standard were
“applied in the traditional civil litigation setting, any complaint
that could withstand Rule 12(b)(6) would automatically be deserving
of injunctive relief as well, rendering the court more a spectator
than a referee when it comes to matters of equity.” Id., at
408 (concurring opinion). Perhaps unsurprisingly, courts that apply
the reasonable-cause standard freely acknowledge that the threshold
merits showing is “significantly lower than a requirement to show
. . . ‘likelihood of success’ ” under the
traditional standard. Overstreet v. El Paso Disposal,
L.P., 625 F.3d 844, 851, n. 10 (CA5 2010); see also
Fleischut v. Nixon Detroit Diesel, Inc., 859 F.2d 26,
29 (CA6 1988) (characterizing the Board’s burden to show reasonable
cause as “relatively insubstantial” (internal quotation marks
omitted)).

															Section 10( j)’s statutory context does not
compel this watered-down approach to equity. The Board and the
partial dissent are correct that §10( j) proceedings are
different from ordinary preliminary-injunction proceedings insofar
as the Board, not the district court, will adjudicate the claims in
the first instance. But, they do not explain why this difference
should matter. The Board suggests that district courts risk
supplanting its adjudicatory authority by conducting an independent
assessment of the merits and equitable factors. But, no matter how
searching the district court’s merits inquiry or what evidence it
considers or credits, the Board remains free to reach its own legal
conclusions and develop its own record in its administrative
proceedings. See Camenisch, 451 U. S., at 395. Also,
since irreparable harm and the other equitable factors are not part
of the unfair-labor-practice claim, the district court’s assessment
of those factors is completely irrelevant to the Board’s
adjudicatory authority.

															The Board and the partial dissent also reason
that district courts should apply a deferential standard because
the Board’s final decisions are reviewed deferentially by a court
of appeals. But, none of the views advanced in a §10( j)
petition represent the Board’s formal position—they are simply the
preliminary legal and factual views of the Board’s in-house
attorneys who investigated and initiated the administrative
complaint. And, deference to what is “nothing more than an agency’s
convenient litigating position” is “entirely inappropriate.”
Bowen v. Georgetown Univ. Hospital, 488 U.S.
204, 213 (1988). The Board’s attempt to salvage the
reasonable-cause standard using statutory context thus fails.

															III

															For the foregoing reasons, we hold that
district courts must apply the traditional four factors articulated
in Winter when considering the Board’s requests for a
preliminary injunction under §10( j). We therefore vacate the
judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand the case for further
proceedings consistent with this opinion.

															It is so ordered.

Notes

*Other courts have applied a
similar two-part test when assessing §10( j) petitions. See,
e.g., Kinard v. Dish Network Corp., 890
F.3d 608, 612 (CA5 2018); Chester v. Grane Healthcare
Co., 666 F.3d 87, 89–90 (CA3 2011).
