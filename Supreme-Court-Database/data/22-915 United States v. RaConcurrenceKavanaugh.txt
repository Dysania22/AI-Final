															SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

															_________________

															No. 22–915

															_________________

															UNITED STATES, PETITIONER v. ZACKEY RAHIMI

															on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for
the fifth circuit

															[June 21, 2024]

															Justice Kavanaugh, concurring.

															The Framers of the Constitution and Bill of Rights wisely sought
the best of both worlds: democratic self-government and the
protection of individual rights against excesses of that form of
government. In justiciable cases, this Court determines whether a
democratically enacted law or other government action infringes on
individual rights guaranteed by the Constitution. When performing
that Article III duty, the Court does not implement its own policy
judgments about, for example, free speech or gun regulation.
Rather, the Court interprets and applies the Constitution by
examining text, pre-ratification and post-ratification history, and
precedent. The Court’s opinion today does just that, and I join it
in full.

															The concurring opinions, and the briefs of the parties and
amici in this case, raise important questions about judicial
reliance on text, history, and precedent, particularly in Second
Amendment cases. I add this concurring opinion to review the proper
roles of text, history, and precedent in constitutional
interpretation.

															I

															The American people established an enduring American
Constitution. The first and most important rule in constitutional
interpretation is to heed the text—that is, the actual words of the
Constitution—and to interpret that text according to its ordinary
meaning as originally understood. The text of the Constitution is
the “Law of the Land.” Art. VI. As a general matter, the text of
the Constitution says what it means and means what it says. And
unless and until it is amended, that text controls.

															In many important provisions, the Constitution is a document of
majestic specificity with “strikingly clean prose.” A. Amar,
America’s Constitution xi (2005). Two Houses of Congress. A House
elected every two years. Senators serve 6-year terms. Two Senators
per State. A State’s equal suffrage in the Senate may not be
changed without the State’s consent. A two-thirds House vote to
expel a Member of the House. The same for the Senate.
Appropriations are made by law. Bicameralism and presentment. The
Presidential veto. The Presidential pardon. The President serves a
4-year term. A maximum of two elected terms for a President. The
salary of a sitting President may not be increased or decreased. A
vote of a majority of the House and two-thirds of the Senate to
remove a President. The President nominates and the Senate confirms
principal executive officers. One Supreme Court. Tenure and salary
protection for Supreme Court and other federal judges. Two-thirds
of each House of Congress together with three-fourths of the States
may amend the Constitution. Congress meets at noon on January 3rd
unless otherwise specified by Congress. The District of Columbia
votes in Presidential elections. The list goes on.

															Those and many other constitutional provisions are relatively
clear. And when the “framers of the Constitution employed words in
their natural sense; and where they are plain and clear, resort to
collateral aids to interpretation is unnecessary and cannot be
indulged in to narrow or enlarge the text.” McPherson v.
Blacker, 146 U.S.
1, 27 (1892).

															Of course, some provisions of the Constitution are broadly
worded or vague—to put it in Madison’s words, “more or less obscure
and equivocal.” The Federalist No. 37, p. 229 (C. Rossiter ed.
1961). As Chief Justice Rehnquist explained, the Constitution is in
some parts “obviously not a specifically worded document but one
couched in general phraseology.” W. Rehnquist, The Notion of a
Living Constitution, 54 Texas L. Rev. 693, 697 (1976).

															That is especially true with respect to the broadly worded or
vague individual-rights provisions. (I will use the terms “broadly
worded” and “vague” interchangeably in this opinion.) For example,
the First Amendment provides that “Congress shall make no law”
“abridging the freedom of speech.” And the Second Amendment, at
issue here, guarantees that “the right of the people to keep and
bear Arms” “shall not be infringed.”

															Read literally, those Amendments might seem to grant
absolute protection, meaning that the government could never
regulate speech or guns in any way. But American law has long
recognized, as a matter of original understanding and original
meaning, that constitutional rights generally come with
exceptions.

															With respect to the First Amendment, for example, this Court’s
“jurisprudence over the past 216”—now 233—“years has rejected an
absolutist interpretation.” Federal Election Comm’n v.
Wisconsin Right to Life, Inc., 551 U.S.
449, 482 (2007) (opinion of Roberts, C. J.); see R. Bork,
Neutral Principles and Some First Amendment Problems, 47 Ind.
L. J. 1, 21–22 (1971). From 1791 to the present, “the First
Amendment has permitted restrictions upon the content of speech in
a few limited areas”—including obscenity, defamation, fraud, and
incitement. United States v. Stevens, 559 U.S.
460, 468 (2010) (quotation marks omitted). So too with respect
to the Second Amendment: “Like most rights, the right secured by
the Second Amendment is not unlimited”; it is “not a right to keep
and carry any weapon whatsoever in any manner whatsoever and for
whatever purpose.” District of Columbia v. Heller,
554
U.S. 570, 626 (2008).

															II

															A recurring and difficult issue for judges, therefore, is how to
interpret vague constitutional text. That issue often arises (as
here) in the context of determining exceptions to textually
guaranteed individual rights. To what extent does the Constitution
allow the government to regulate speech or guns, for
example?[1]

															In many cases, judicial precedent informs or controls the answer
(more on that later). But absent precedent, there are really only
two potential answers to the question of how to determine
exceptions to broadly worded constitutional rights: history or
policy.

															Generally speaking, the historical approach examines the laws,
practices, and understandings from before and after ratification
that may help the interpreter discern the meaning of the
constitutional text and the principles embodied in that text. The
policy approach rests on the philosophical or policy dispositions
of the individual judge.

															History, not policy, is the proper guide.

															For more than 200 years, this Court has relied on history when
construing vague constitutional text in all manner of
constitutional disputes. For good reason. History can supply
evidence of the original meaning of vague text. History is far less
subjective than policy. And reliance on history is more consistent
with the properly neutral judicial role than an approach where
judges subtly (or not so subtly) impose their own policy views on
the American people.

															Judges are like umpires, as The Chief Justice has aptly
explained. And in a constitutional system that counts on an
independent Judiciary, judges must act like umpires. To be an
umpire, the judge “must stick close to the text and the history,
and their fair implications,” because there “is no principled way”
for a neutral judge “to prefer any claimed human value to any
other.” R. Bork, Neutral Principles and Some First Amendment
Problems, 47 Ind. L. J. 1, 8 (1971). History establishes a
“criterion that is conceptually quite separate from the preferences
of the judge himself.” A. Scalia, Originalism: The Lesser Evil, 57
U. Cin. L. Rev. 849, 864 (1989). When properly applied, history
helps ensure that judges do not simply create constitutional
meaning “out of whole cloth.” A. Scalia, The Rule of Law as a Law
of Rules, 56 U. Chi. L. Rev. 1175, 1183 (1989).[2]

															Absent precedent, therefore, history guides the interpretation
of vague constitutional text. Of course, this Court has been
deciding constitutional cases for about 230 years, so relevant
precedent often exists. As the Court’s opinions over time amply
demonstrate, precedent matters a great deal in constitutional
interpretation.

															I now turn to explaining how courts apply pre-ratification
history, post-ratification history, and precedent when analyzing
vague constitutional text.

															A

															Pre-ratification history. When interpreting vague
constitutional text, the Court typically scrutinizes the stated
intentions and understandings of the Framers and Ratifiers of the
Constitution (or, as relevant, the Amendments). The Court also
looks to the understandings of the American people from the
pertinent ratification era. Those intentions and understandings do
not necessarily determine meaning, but they may be strong evidence
of meaning. See generally, e.g., The Federalist (C. Rossiter
ed. 1961); Records of the Federal Convention of 1787 (M. Farrand
ed. 1911); Debates on the Federal Constitution (J. Elliot ed.
1836).

															Especially for the original Constitution and the Bill of Rights,
the Court also examines the pre-ratification history in the
American Colonies, including pre-ratification laws and practices.
And the Court pays particular attention to the historical laws and
practices in the United States from Independence in 1776 until
ratification in 1788 or 1791. Pre-ratification American history can
shed light on constitutional meaning in various ways.

															For example, some provisions of the Constitution use language
that appeared in the Articles of Confederation or state
constitutional provisions. And when the language that appeared in
the Articles of Confederation or in state constitutions is the same
as or similar to the language in the U. S. Constitution, the
history of how people understood the language in the Articles or
state constitutions can inform interpretation of that language in
the U. S. Constitution. See, e.g., Moore
v. Harper, 600 U.S. 1, 33 (2023) (the “Framers did not write
the Elections Clause on a blank slate—they instead borrowed from
the Articles of Confederation” as evidenced by their use of
“closely parallel” language); District of Columbia v.
Heller, 554 U.S.
570, 600–601 (2008) (“Our interpretation is confirmed by
analogous arms-bearing rights in state constitutions that preceded
and immediately followed adoption of the Second Amendment”);
United States Steel Corp. v.
Multistate Tax Comm’n, 434 U.S.
452, 460, and n. 10 (1978) (“The history of interstate
agreements under the Articles of Confederation suggests the same
distinction between ‘treaties, alliances, and confederations’ on
the one hand, and ‘agreements and compacts’ on the other,” as the
distinction made in the Constitution’s Treaty and Compact
Clauses).

															Similarly, other pre-ratification national or state laws and
practices may sometimes help an interpreter discern the meaning of
particular constitutional provisions. Those pre-ratification
American laws and practices formed part of the foundation on which
the Framers constructed the Constitution and Bill of Rights.
Indeed, the Constitution did not displace but largely co-exists
with state constitutions and state laws, except to the extent they
conflict with federal law. See Art. VI.

															On the other hand, some pre-ratification history can be
probative of what the Constitution does not mean. The
Framers drafted and approved many provisions of the Constitution
precisely to depart from rather than adhere to certain
pre-ratification laws, practices, or understandings.

															For example, the “defects” of the Articles of Confederation
inspired some of the key decisions made by the Framers in
Philadelphia and by the First Congress in drafting the Bill of
Rights. The Federalist No. 37, at 224 (J. Madison); see,
e.g., id., at 226 (“the existing Confederation
is founded on principles which are fallacious; that we must
consequently change this first foundation, and with it the
superstructure resting upon it”); PennEast Pipeline Co.
v. New Jersey, 594 U.S. 482, 508 (2021) (“When the
Framers met in Philadelphia in the summer of 1787, they sought to
create a cohesive national sovereign in response to the failings of
the Articles of Confederation”); Sosa v.
Alvarez-Machain, 542 U.S.
692, 716–717 (2004) (“The Continental Congress was hamstrung by
its inability to ‘cause infractions of treaties, or of the law of
nations to be punished,’ ” and the “Framers responded by
vesting the Supreme Court with original jurisdiction over ‘all
Cases affecting Ambassadors, other public ministers and Consuls,’
and the First Congress followed through” (citation omitted));
U. S. Term Limits, Inc. v. Thornton, 514 U.S.
779, 803 (1995) (“After the Constitutional Convention convened,
the Framers were presented with, and eventually adopted a variation
of, a plan not merely to amend the Articles of Confederation but to
create an entirely new National Government with a National
Executive, National Judiciary, and a National Legislature”
(quotation marks omitted)).

															The pre-ratification history of America’s many objections to
British laws and the system of oppressive British rule over the
Colonies—identified most prominently in the Declaration of
Independence—can likewise inform interpretation of some of the
crucial provisions of the original Constitution and Bill of Rights.
Compare Declaration of Independence ¶11 (under British rule, the
King “made Judges dependent on his Will alone, for the tenure of
their offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries”) with
U. S. Const., Art. III, §1 (“The Judges, both of the
supreme and inferior Courts, shall hold their Offices during good
Behaviour, and shall, at stated Times, receive for their Services,
a Compensation, which shall not be diminished during their
Continuance in Office”); see, e.g., The Federalist
No. 37, at 226 (“The most that the convention could do” “was to
avoid the errors suggested by the past experience of other
countries, as well as of our own”); 1 Annals of Cong. 436 (1789)
(J. Madison) (“The freedom of the press and rights of conscience,
those choicest privileges of the people, are unguarded in the
British Constitution”).

															This Court has recognized, for example, that no “purpose in
ratifying the Bill of Rights was clearer than that of securing for
the people of the United States much greater freedom of religion,
expression, assembly, and petition than the people of Great Britain
had ever enjoyed.” Bridges v. California,
314 U.S.
252, 265 (1941). Ratified as it was “while the memory of many
oppressive English restrictions on the enumerated liberties was
still fresh,” the Bill of Rights “cannot reasonably be taken as
approving prevalent English practices.” Ibid.; see,
e.g., Hosanna-Tabor Evangelical Lutheran Church
and School v. EEOC, 565 U.S.
171, 183 (2012) (“Familiar with life under the established
Church of England, the founding generation sought to foreclose the
possibility of a national church” through the First Amendment’s
Establishment Clause); Powell v. Alabama,
287 U.S.
45, 60 (1932) (right to counsel under the Sixth Amendment
reflected America’s rejection of the English common law rule that a
“person charged with treason or felony was denied the aid of
counsel”).[3]

															The Equal Protection Clause provides another example. Ratified
in 1868, that Clause sought to reject the Nation’s history of
racial discrimination, not to backdoor incorporate racially
discriminatory and oppressive historical practices and laws into
the Constitution. See generally Flowers v.
Mississippi, 588 U.S. 284 (2019); Batson v.
Kentucky, 476 U.S.
79 (1986); Loving v. Virginia, 388 U.S. 1
(1967); Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U.S.
483 (1954).

															In short, pre-ratification American history—that is,
pre-ratification laws, practices, and understandings—can inform
interpretation of vague constitutional provisions in the original
Constitution and Bill of Rights. The same principle of looking to
relevant pre-ratification history applies when interpreting broadly
worded language in the later amendments, including the Fourteenth
Amendment ratified in 1868. But in using pre-ratification history,
courts must exercise care to rely only on the history that the
Constitution actually incorporated and not on the history that the
Constitution left behind.

															B

															Post-ratification history. As the Framers made clear, and
as this Court has stated time and again for more than two
centuries, post-ratification history—sometimes referred to as
tradition—can also be important for interpreting vague
constitutional text and determining exceptions to individual
constitutional rights. When the text is vague and the
pre-ratification history is elusive or inconclusive,
post-ratification history becomes especially important. Indeed,
absent precedent, there can be little else to guide a judge
deciding a constitutional case in that situation, unless the judge
simply defaults to his or her own policy preferences.

															After ratification, the National Government and the state
governments began interpreting and applying the Constitution’s
text. They have continued to do so ever since. As the national and
state governments over time have enacted laws and implemented
practices to promote the general welfare, those laws and practices
have often reflected and reinforced common understandings of the
Constitution’s authorizations and limitations.

															Post-ratification interpretations and applications by government
actors—at least when reasonably consistent and longstanding—can be
probative of the meaning of vague constitutional text. The
collective understanding of Americans who, over time, have
interpreted and applied the broadly worded constitutional text can
provide good guidance for a judge who is trying to interpret that
same text decades or centuries later. See, e.g.,
Republican Party of Minn. v. White, 536 U.S.
765, 785 (2002) (a “universal and long-established tradition of
prohibiting certain conduct creates a strong presumption that the
prohibition is constitutional” (quotation marks omitted));
United States v. Midwest Oil Co., 236 U.S.
459, 472–473 (1915) (“officers, law-makers and citizens
naturally adjust themselves to any long-continued action” of the
government “on the presumption that” unconstitutional “acts would
not have been allowed to be so often repeated as to crystallize
into a regular practice”); McPherson v. Blacker,
146 U.S.
1, 27 (1892) (when constitutional text is vague,
“contemporaneous and subsequent practical construction are entitled
to the greatest weight”).[4]

															Importantly, the Framers themselves intended that
post-ratification history would shed light on the meaning of vague
constitutional text. They understood that some constitutional text
may be “more or less obscure and equivocal” such that questions
“daily occur in the course of practice.” The Federalist No. 37, at
228–229. Madison explained that the meaning of vague text would be
“liquidated and ascertained by a series of particular discussions
and adjudications.” Id., at 229. In other words, Madison
articulated the Framers’ expectation and intent that
post-ratification history would be a proper and important tool to
help constitutional interpreters determine the meaning of vague
constitutional text.

															From early on, this Court followed Madison’s lead. In 1819, in
one of its most important decisions ever, the Court addressed the
scope of Article I’s Necessary and Proper Clause. McCulloch
v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316 (1819). Writing for the Court,
Chief Justice Marshall invoked post-ratification history to
conclude that Congress’s authority to establish a national bank
could “scarcely be considered as an open question.” Id., at
401. The constitutionality of the national bank had “been
recognised by many successive legislatures,” and an “exposition of
the constitution, deliberately established by legislative acts, on
the faith of which an immense property has been advanced, ought not
to be lightly disregarded.” Ibid. Marshall added: The
“respective powers of those who are equally the representatives of
the people, are to be adjusted; if not put at rest by the practice
of the government, ought to receive a considerable impression from
that practice.” Ibid.

															In relying on post-ratification history as a proper tool to
discern constitutional meaning, Madison and Marshall make for a
formidable duo. Moving from distant American history to more recent
times, one can add Justice Scalia. Throughout his consequential
30-year tenure on this Court, Justice Scalia repeatedly emphasized
that constitutional interpretation must take account of text,
pre-ratification history, and post-ratification history—the last of
which he often referred to as “tradition.” In his words, when
judges interpret vague or broadly worded constitutional text, the
“traditions of our people” are “paramount.” McDonald v.
Chicago, 561 U.S.
742, 792 (2010) (Scalia, J., concurring). Constitutional
interpretation should reflect “the principles adhered to, over
time, by the American people, rather than those favored by the
personal (and necessarily shifting) philosophical dispositions of a
majority of this Court.” Rutan v. Republican Party of
Ill., 497 U.S.
62, 96 (1990) (Scalia, J., dissenting).

															The U. S. Reports are well stocked with Scalia opinions
looking to post-ratification history and tradition.[5] In Heller, Justice Scalia wrote for
the Court that “a critical tool of constitutional interpretation”
is “the examination of a variety of legal and other sources to
determine the public understanding of a legal text in the
period after its enactment or ratification.” 554 U. S., at 605
(emphasis in original); see also ibid. (“We now address how
the Second Amendment was interpreted from immediately after its
ratification through the end of the 19th century”).

															Heller echoed years of earlier Scalia opinions. To take
one: “Where the meaning of a constitutional text (such as ‘the
freedom of speech’) is unclear, the widespread and long-accepted
practices of the American people are the best indication of what
fundamental beliefs it was intended to enshrine.” McIntyre
v. Ohio Elections Comm’n, 514
U.S. 334, 378 (1995) (Scalia, J., dissenting). Or another: A
“venerable and accepted tradition is not to be laid on the
examining table and scrutinized for its conformity to some abstract
principle” of “adjudication devised by this Court. To the contrary,
such traditions are themselves the stuff out of which the Court’s
principles are to be formed. They are, in these uncertain areas,
the very points of reference by which the legitimacy or
illegitimacy of other practices is to be figured out.”
Rutan, 497 U. S., at 95–96 (Scalia, J., dissenting)
(emphasis in original).

															As leading actors and theorists in the earliest and latest
chapters of the American constitutional story, Madison, Marshall,
and Scalia made clear that courts should look to post-ratification
history as well as pre-ratification history to interpret vague
constitutional text.

															For more than two centuries—from the early 1800s to this
case—this Court has done just that. The Court has repeatedly
employed post-ratification history to determine the meaning of
vague constitutional text. Reliance on post-ratification history
“has shaped scores of Court cases spanning all domains of
constitutional law, every era of the nation’s history, and Justices
of every stripe.” S. Girgis, Living Traditionalism, 98 N. Y. U. L.
Rev. 1477, 1480 (2023); see, e.g., Consumer Financial
Protection Bureau v. Community Financial Services Assn. of
America, Ltd., 601 U.S. 416, 441–445 (2024) (Kagan, J.,
concurring); Trump v. Anderson, 601 U.S. 100, 113–115

															C

															Precedent. With a Constitution and a Supreme Court that
are both more than two centuries old, this Court and other courts
are rarely interpreting a constitutional provision for the first
time. Rather, a substantial body of Supreme Court precedent already
exists for many provisions of the Constitution.

															Precedent is fundamental to day-to-day constitutional
decisionmaking in this Court and every American court. The
“judicial Power” established in Article III incorporates the
principle of stare decisis, both vertical and horizontal. As
Hamilton stated, to “avoid an arbitrary discretion in the courts,
it is indispensable that they should be bound down by strict rules
and precedents” that will “unavoidably swell to a very considerable
bulk” and “serve to define and point out their duty in every
particular case that comes before them.” The Federalist No. 78, at
471 (A. Hamilton).

															Courts must respect precedent, while at the same time
recognizing that precedent on occasion may appropriately be
overturned. See, e.g., Brown, 347 U.S.
483; West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish,
300 U.S.
379 (1937); see also Ramos v. Louisiana, 590 U.S.
83, 115–132 (2020) (Kavanaugh, J., concurring in part). In light of
the significant amount of Supreme Court precedent that has built up
over time, this Court and other courts often decide constitutional
cases by reference to those extensive bodies of precedent.

															Even then, however, text and history still matter a great deal.
When determining how broadly or narrowly to read a precedent; when
determining whether to extend, limit, or narrow a precedent; or in
relatively infrequent cases, when determining whether to overrule a
precedent, a court often will consider how the precedent squares
with the Constitution’s text and history. Therefore, the text, as
well as pre-ratification and post-ratification history, may
appropriately function as a gravitational pull on the Court’s
interpretation of precedent. See Free Enterprise Fund
v. Public Company Accounting Oversight Bd., 537 F.3d
667, 698 (CADC 2008) (Kavanaugh, J., dissenting) (“We should
resolve questions about the scope of those precedents in light of
and in the direction of the constitutional text and constitutional
history”).

															But the first stop in this Court’s constitutional decisionmaking
is the Court’s precedents—the accumulated wisdom of jurists from
Marshall and Story to Harlan and Taft; from Hughes and Black to
Jackson and White; from Rehnquist and O’Connor to Kennedy and
Scalia; and so on.

															III

															Some say that courts should determine exceptions to broadly
worded individual rights, including the Second Amendment, by
looking to policy. Uphold a law if it is a good idea; strike it
down if it is not. True, the proponents of a policy-based approach
to interpretation of broadly worded or vague constitutional text
usually do not say so explicitly (although some do). Rather, they
support a balancing approach variously known as means-end scrutiny,
heightened scrutiny, tiers of scrutiny, rational basis with bite,
or strict or intermediate or intermediate-plus or rigorous or
skeptical scrutiny. Whatever the label of the day, that balancing
approach is policy by another name. It requires judges to weigh the
benefits against the burdens of a law and to uphold the law as
constitutional if, in the judge’s view, the law is sufficiently
reasonable or important. See M. Barnes E. Chemerinsky, The Once and
Future Equal Protection Doctrine?, 43 Conn. L. Rev. 1059, 1080
(2011) (“The levels of scrutiny are essentially balancing
tests”).

															To begin, as I have explained, that kind of balancing approach
to constitutional interpretation departs from what Framers such as
Madison stated, what jurists such as Marshall and Scalia did, what
judges as umpires should strive to do, and what this Court has
actually done across the constitutional landscape for the last two
centuries.

															The balancing tests (heightened scrutiny and the like) are a
relatively modern judicial innovation in constitutional
decisionmaking. The “tiers of scrutiny have no basis in the text or
original meaning of the Constitution.” J. Alicea J. Ohlendorf,
Against the Tiers of Constitutional Scrutiny, National Affairs 72,
73 (2019). And before the late 1950s, “what we would now call
strict judicial scrutiny did not exist.” R. Fallon, The Nature of
Constitutional Rights: The Invention and Logic of Strict Judicial
Scrutiny 30 (2019).

															The Court “appears to have adopted” heightened-scrutiny tests
“by accident” in the 1950s and 1960s in a series of Communist
speech cases, “rather than as the result of a considered judgment.”
Simon Schuster, Inc. v. Members of N. Y. State Crime
Victims Bd., 502 U.S.
105, 125 (1991) (Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment). The
Court has employed balancing only in discrete areas of
constitutional law—and even in those cases, history still tends to
play a far larger role than overt judicial policymaking.[7]

															To be clear, I am not suggesting that the Court overrule cases
where the Court has applied those heightened-scrutiny tests. But I
am challenging the notion that those tests are the ordinary
approach to constitutional interpretation. And I am arguing against
extending those tests to new areas, including the Second
Amendment.

															One major problem with using a balancing approach to determine
exceptions to constitutional rights is that it requires highly
subjective judicial evaluations of how important a law is—at least
unless the balancing test itself incorporates history, in which
case judges might as well just continue to rely on history
directly.

															The subjective balancing approach forces judges to act more like
legislators who decide what the law should be, rather than judges
who “say what the law is.” Marbury v. Madison, 1
Cranch 137, 177 (1803). That is because the balancing approach
requires judges to weigh the benefits of a law against its
burdens—a value-laden and political task that is usually reserved
for the political branches. And that power in essence vests judges
with “a roving commission to second-guess” legislators and
administrative officers “concerning what is best for the country.”
W. Rehnquist, The Notion of a Living Constitution, 54 Texas L. Rev.
693, 698 (1976). Stated otherwise, when a court “does not have a
solid textual anchor or an established social norm from which to
derive the general rule, its pronouncement appears uncomfortably
like legislation.” A. Scalia, The Rule of Law as a Law of Rules, 56
U. Chi. L. Rev. 1175, 1185 (1989).

															Moreover, the balancing approach is ill-defined. Some judges
will apply heightened scrutiny with a presumption in favor of
deference to the legislature. Other judges will apply heightened
scrutiny with a presumption in favor of the individual right in
question. Because it is unmoored, the balancing approach presents
the real “danger” that “judges will mistake their own predilections
for the law.” A. Scalia, Originalism: The Lesser Evil, 57 U. Cin.
L. Rev. 849, 863 (1989). Under the balancing approach, to use
Justice Scalia’s characteristically vivid description, if “We The
Court conclude that They The People’s answers to a problem” are
unwise, “we are free to intervene,” but if we “think the States may
be on to something, we can loosen the leash.” McDonald v.
Chicago, 561 U.S.
742, 803 (2010) (concurring opinion) (quotation marks
omitted).

															The balancing approach can be antithetical to the principle that
judges must act like umpires. It turns judges into players. Justice
Black once protested that the Court should not balance away bedrock
free speech protections for the perceived policy needs of the
moment. He argued that “the balancing approach” “disregards all of
the unique features of our Constitution” by giving “the Court,
along with Congress, a greater power, that of overriding the plain
commands of the Bill of Rights on a finding of weighty public
interest.” H. Black, The Bill of Rights, 35 N. Y. U. L. Rev. 865,
878–879 (1960). Like Justice Black, the Court in Heller
cautioned that a “constitutional guarantee subject to future
judges’ assessments of its usefulness is no constitutional
guarantee at all.” 554 U.S.
570, 634 (2008).

															Some respond that history can be difficult to decipher. It is
true that using history to interpret vague text can require
“nuanced judgments,” McDonald, 561 U. S., at 803–804
(Scalia, J., concurring), and is “sometimes inconclusive,” Scalia,
Originalism: The Lesser Evil, 57 U. Cin. L. Rev., at 864. But
at a minimum, history tends to narrow the range of possible
meanings that may be ascribed to vague constitutional language. A
history-based methodology supplies direction and imposes a neutral
and democratically infused constraint on judicial
decisionmaking.

															The historical approach is not perfect. But “the question to be
decided is not whether the historically focused method is a
perfect means of restraining aristocratic judicial
Constitution-writing; but whether it is the best means
available in an imperfect world.” McDonald, 561
U. S., at 804 (Scalia, J., concurring) (emphasis in original).
And the historical approach is superior to judicial policymaking.
The historical approach “depends upon a body of evidence
susceptible of reasoned analysis rather than a variety of vague
ethico-political First Principles whose combined conclusion can be
found to point in any direction the judges favor.” Ibid.
Moreover, the historical approach “intrudes less upon the
democratic process because the rights it acknowledges are those
established by a constitutional history formed by democratic
decisions; and the rights it fails to acknowledge are left to be
democratically adopted or rejected by the people.” Id., at
805.

															IV

															This Court’s Second Amendment jurisprudence has carefully
followed and reinforced the Court’s longstanding approach to
constitutional interpretation—relying on text, pre-ratification and
post-ratification history, and precedent.

															In Heller, the Court began with the baseline point that
the Second Amendment textually guarantees an individual right. The
Court then explained that the Second Amendment right is, of course,
“not a right to keep and carry any weapon whatsoever in any manner
whatsoever and for whatever purpose” and is subject to “important”
limitations. 554
U.S. 570, 626–627 (2008).

															Although Heller declined to “undertake an exhaustive
historical analysis,” it recognized a few categories of traditional
exceptions to the right. Id., at 626. For example,
Heller indicated that: (i) “prohibitions on carrying
concealed weapons were lawful”; (ii) the Second Amendment attaches
only to weapons “in common use” because “that limitation is fairly
supported by the historical tradition of prohibiting the carrying
of dangerous and unusual weapons”; and (iii) “longstanding
prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons and the
mentally ill, or laws forbidding the carrying of firearms in
sensitive places such as schools and government buildings, or laws
imposing conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of
arms” are presumptively constitutional. Id., at 626–627
(quotation marks omitted).

															In McDonald, the Court held that the Second Amendment was
incorporated against the States. In so holding, the Court
reiterated the presumed constitutionality of the “longstanding
regulatory measures” identified in Heller. 561 U.S.
742, 786 (2010) (plurality opinion).

															Then, in Bruen, the Court repeated that the “Nation’s
historical tradition of firearm regulation” guides the
constitutional analysis of gun regulations and exceptions to the
right to bear arms. 597 U.S. 1, 17 (2022); see id., at 79–81
(Kavanaugh, J., concurring).

															This Court’s approach in those three recent Second Amendment
cases—and in the Court’s opinion today—is entirely consistent with
the Court’s longstanding reliance on history and precedent to
determine the meaning of vague constitutional text. Heller
rested on “constitutional text and history,” ante, at 6
(quotation marks omitted), and laid the foundation for
McDonald and then Bruen.

															In today’s case, the Court carefully builds on Heller,
McDonald, and Bruen. The Court applies the historical
test that those precedents have set forth—namely, “whether the new
law is relevantly similar to laws that our tradition is understood
to permit.” Ante, at 7 (quotation marks omitted). The Court
examines “our historical tradition of firearm regulation,”
ante, at 6 (quotation marks omitted), and correctly holds
that America’s “tradition of firearm regulation allows the
Government to disarm individuals who present a credible threat to
the physical safety of others,” ante, at 16. The law before
us “fits neatly within the tradition the surety and going armed
laws represent.” Ante, at 13–14.

															As the Court’s decision today notes, Second Amendment
jurisprudence is still in the relatively early innings, unlike the
First, Fourth, and Sixth Amendments, for example. That is because
the Court did not have occasion to recognize the Second Amendment’s
individual right until recently. See generally Heller v.
District of Columbia, 670 F.3d 1244, 1269–1296 (CADC 2011)
(Kavanaugh, J., dissenting). Deciding constitutional cases in a
still-developing area of this Court’s jurisprudence can sometimes
be difficult. But that is not a permission slip for a judge to let
constitutional analysis morph into policy preferences under the
guise of a balancing test that churns out the judge’s own policy
beliefs.

															*  *  *

															As exemplified by Heller, McDonald, Bruen,
and the Court’s opinion today, constitutional interpretation
properly takes account of text, pre-ratification and
post-ratification history, and precedent. Those are the tools of
the trade for an American judge interpreting the American
Constitution. Of course, difficult subsidiary questions can arise
about how to apply those tools, both generally and in particular
cases. And in some cases, text, history, and precedent may point in
somewhat different directions. In law as in life, nothing is
perfect. But in Second Amendment cases as in other constitutional
cases, text, history, and precedent must remain paramount.

Notes
1
 There are two ways to
frame this point—either (i) determining the exceptions to a
constitutional right or (ii) determining the affirmative scope or
contours of that constitutional right. Either way, the analysis is
the same—does the constitutional provision, as originally
understood, permit the challenged law? This opinion uses the term
“exceptions,” which underscores that the constitutional baseline is
protection of the textually enumerated right. See Federal
Election Comm’n v. Wisconsin Right to Life, Inc.,
551 U.S.
449, 482 (2007) (opinion of Roberts, C. J.) (stating in a
First Amendment case that “it is worth recalling the language we
are applying”).
2
 The historical approach
applies when the text is vague. But the text of the Constitution
always controls. So history contrary to clear text is not to be
followed. See, e.g., INS v. Chadha, 462 U.S.
919, 945–959 (1983); Powell v. McCormack,
395 U.S.
486, 546–547 (1969); Brown v. Board of Education,
347 U.S.
483, 490–495, and n. 5 (1954); cf. Sedition Act of 1798, ch.
74, 1 Stat. 596. In some cases, there may be debate about whether
the relevant text is sufficiently clear to override contrary
historical practices. See, e.g., NLRB v. Noel
Canning, 573
U.S. 513, 613 (2014) (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment)
(“What the majority needs to sustain its judgment is an ambiguous
text and a clear historical practice. What it has is a clear text
and an at-best-ambiguous historical practice”). The basic principle
remains: Text controls over contrary historical
practices.
3
 To be sure, as the
Court’s cases reveal, pre-ratification English law and practices
may supply background for some constitutional provisions. But the
Constitution, including the Bill of Rights, did not purport to take
English law or history wholesale and silently download it into the
U. S. Constitution. See, e.g., Harmelin v.
Michigan, 501
U.S. 957, 975 (1991) (opinion of Scalia, J.) (“Unless one
accepts the notion of a blind incorporation, however, the ultimate
question is not what ‘cruell and unusuall punishments’ meant in the
[English] Declaration of Rights, but what its meaning was to the
Americans who adopted the Eighth Amendment”). Therefore,
reflexively resorting to English law or history without careful
analysis can sometimes be problematic because America had fought a
war—and would soon fight another in 1812—to free itself from
British law and practices and rid itself of tyrannical British
rule. See The Federalist No. 45, p. 289 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961) (J.
Madison) (“Was, then, the American Revolution effected, was the
American Confederacy formed, was the precious blood of thousands
spilt, and the hard-earned substance of millions lavished, not that
the people of America should enjoy peace, liberty, and safety,” but
that they should continue to be subject to the “impious doctrine in
the old world, that the people were made for kings, not kings for
the people”?).

 Post-ratification history
is sometimes also referred to as tradition, liquidation, or
historical gloss. Those concepts are probably not identical in all
respects. In any event, in applying those concepts in
constitutional interpretation, some important questions can arise,
such as: (i) the level of generality at which to define a
historical practice; (ii) how widespread a historical
practice must have been; (iii) how long ago it must have
started; and (iv) how long it must have endured. Although this
Court’s constitutional precedents routinely rely on
post-ratification history, those precedents do not supply a
one-size-fits-all answer to those various methodological questions.
See, e.g., Noel Canning, 573 U. S., at
522–556; Youngstown Sheet Tube Co. v. Sawyer,
343 U.S.
579, 610–611 (1952) (Frankfurter, J., concurring). And I will
not attempt to answer all of those questions here. Respected
scholars are continuing to undertake careful analysis. See
generally J. Alicea, Practice-Based Constitutional Theories, 133

Dobbs, Bruen, and Kennedy: The Role of History

 Justice Scalia’s opinions
“made extensive use of post-ratification history,” and “his
assessment of post-ratification history” in those opinions extended
“far beyond the time of enactment.” M. Ramsey, Beyond the Text:
Justice Scalia’s Originalism in Practice, 92 Notre Dame
L. Rev. 1945, 1957, 1960 (2017). Justice Scalia did not
necessarily “use[ ] tradition as an independent source of
interpretive authority; rather, he had a very broad view of what
traditions might be indicative of original meaning.” Id., at
1962, n. 79; see, e.g., NLRB v. Noel
Canning, 573 U.S.
513, 584–593, 602–615 (2014) (Scalia, J., concurring in
judgment); District of Columbia v. Heller, 554 U.S.

 The Court has similarly
relied on history when deciding cases involving textually
unenumerated rights under the Due Process Clause or the Privileges
or Immunities Clause. In those contexts, the baseline is
180-degrees different: The text supplies no express protection of
any asserted substantive right. The Court has recognized exceptions
to that textual baseline, but in doing so has regularly observed
that the Fourteenth Amendment “specially protects those fundamental
rights and liberties which are, objectively, deeply rooted in this
Nation’s history and tradition.” Washington v.
Glucksberg, 521 U.S.
702, 720–721 (1997) (quotation marks omitted); see,
e.g., Pierce v. Society of Sisters,
268 U.S.
510, 534–535 (1925) (“liberty of parents and guardians to
direct the upbringing and education of children under their
control”).
7
 The Court has articulated
a heightened-scrutiny test in some pockets of free-speech
jurisprudence. But even when invoking heightened scrutiny in that
context, the Court still often relies directly on history. See,
e.g., City of Austin v. Reagan Nat. Advertising of
Austin, LLC, 596 U.S. 61, 75 (2022) (a city’s regulation of
solely off-premises billboards was within “the Nation’s history of
regulating off-premises signs” as “federal, state, and local
jurisdictions have repeatedly relied upon on-/off-premises
distinctions” “for the last 50-plus years”); Perry Ed. Assn.
v. Perry Local Educators’ Assn., 460 U.S.
37, 45–46 (1983) (“In places which by long tradition” “have
been devoted to assembly and debate, the rights of the State to
limit expressive activity are sharply circumscribed”). The Court
has also used heightened scrutiny in certain equal protection
cases. As discussed above, the Equal Protection Clause rejected the
history of racially discriminatory laws and practices.
