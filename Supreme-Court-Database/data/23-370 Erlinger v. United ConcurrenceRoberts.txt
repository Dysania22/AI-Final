															SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

															_________________

															No. 23–370

															_________________

															PAUL ERLINGER, PETITIONER v. UNITED
STATES

															on writ of certiorari to the united states
court of appeals for the seventh circuit

															[June 21, 2024]

															Chief Justice Roberts, concurring.

															I join the opinion of the Court because I agree
that under the Fifth and Sixth Amendments, a defendant is entitled
to have a jury determine beyond a reasonable doubt whether his
predicate offenses were committed on different occasions for
purposes of the Armed Career Criminal Act. But as Justice Kavanaugh
explains, violations of that right are subject to harmless error
review. See post, at 9–11 (dissenting opinion). The Seventh
Circuit should thus consider on remand the Government’s contention
that the error here was harmless.
