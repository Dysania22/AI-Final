															ALEX CANTERO, et al., individually and on
behalf of all others similarly situated, PETITIONERS v. BANK
OF AMERICA, N. A.

															on writ of certiorari to the united states
court of appeals for the second circuit

															[May 30, 2024]

															

															Justice Kavanaugh delivered the opinion of the
Court.

															Federal law extensively regulates national banks
such as Bank of America and expressly preempts some (but not all)
state laws that regulate national banks. This case concerns the
standard for determining when state laws that regulate national
banks are preempted. As relevant here, the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010
expressly incorporated the standard that this Court articulated in
Barnett Bank of Marion County, N. A. v. Nelson,
517 U.S.
25 (1996). 12 U. S. C. §25b(b)(1)(B). That standard
asks whether a state law “prevents or significantly interferes with
the exercise by the national bank of its powers.” Ibid.
Because the Court of Appeals in this case did not apply that
standard in a manner consistent with Dodd-Frank and Barnett
Bank, we vacate and remand.

															I

															A

															The United States maintains a dual system of
banking, made up of parallel federal and state banking systems.
That dual system allows privately owned banks to choose whether to
obtain a charter from the Federal Government or from a state
government.

															Banks with federal charters, called national
banks, are subject primarily to federal oversight and regulation.
And banks with state charters, called state banks, are subject to
additional state oversight and regulation. Those two banking
systems co-exist and compete.

															The national banking system began in 1863 when
Treasury Secretary (later Chief Justice) Salmon Chase proposed,
Congress passed, and President Lincoln signed the National Bank
Act. 12Stat. 665; 13Stat. 99. When a bank obtains a federal charter
under the National Bank Act, the national bank gains various
enumerated and incidental powers. 12 U. S. C. §24. The
National Bank Act expressly affords national banks the powers that
they need to organize and operate—for example, the powers to “make
contracts,” to “sue and be sued,” and to “elect or appoint” a
“board of directors.” §24. The Act also provides national banks
with banking-specific powers. As relevant here, the Act expressly
supplies national banks with the power to “make, arrange, purchase
or sell loans or extensions of credit secured by liens on interests
in real estate”—in other words, to administer home mortgage loans.
§371(a). The Act also expressly authorizes national banks to
exercise “all such incidental powers as shall be necessary to carry
on the business of banking.” §24.

															When national banks make home mortgage loans,
they often offer escrow accounts. Mortgage-escrow accounts are
designed to protect both the bank and the borrower. When the
borrower makes a mortgage payment, the borrower puts money into an
escrow account operated by the bank; the bank then uses the funds
in escrow to pay the borrower’s insurance premium and property
taxes on the borrower’s behalf. That arrangement helps the borrower
by simplifying expenses and budgeting. Instead of having to pay
large lump-sum insurance and tax payments once or twice a year, the
borrower can instead make small payments throughout the year. And
the arrangement also assists the bank by ensuring that the
borrower’s insurance and tax bills are timely paid, thus protecting
the loan collateral (the home) against tax foreclosure or uninsured
damage.

															In light of those benefits to both sides, the
vast majority of home mortgages come with escrow accounts. Indeed,
many federal agencies and programs require them. The Federal
Housing Administration and the Department of Agriculture’s Rural
Housing Service, for example, mandate escrow accounts for mortgages
that they administer or insure.

															In the 1970s, Congress found that some national
banks were engaging in “certain abusive practices” and that
“significant reforms” were necessary to protect borrowers. 12
U. S. C. §2601(a). To that end, Congress passed and
President Ford signed the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act of
1974, or RESPA. Among other things, RESPA extensively regulates
national banks’ operation of escrow accounts. RESPA first sets out
the general terms for national banks that operate escrow accounts.
For example, RESPA requires national banks to “promptly retur[n] to
the borrower” any funds left over after the loan is paid, §2605(g),
and to provide borrowers with notifications and account statements,
§§2609(b), (c). RESPA also contains a specific safeguard for
borrowers: It caps the amount that national banks can require
borrowers to deposit into escrow accounts. §2609(a). But as
relevant to this case, RESPA (unlike New York law, as we will
discuss) does not mandate that national banks pay interest to
borrowers on the balances of their escrow accounts.[1]

															B

															Bank of America is a national bank chartered
under the National Bank Act. Bank of America offers mortgage loans
to homeowners, among other services.

															In 2010, Alex Cantero obtained a home mortgage
loan from Bank of America to purchase a house in Queens Village,
New York. In 2016, Saul Hymes and Ilana Harwayne-Gidansky similarly
obtained a home mortgage loan from Bank of America to buy a house
in East Setauket, New York. Both mortgage contracts required the
borrowers to make monthly deposits into escrow accounts, which Bank
of America used to pay the borrowers’ property taxes and insurance
premiums when those taxes and premiums came due.

															Under New York law, when a bank “maintains an
escrow account pursuant to any agreement executed in connection
with a mortgage” on certain real estate, the bank “shall” pay
borrowers “interest at a rate of not less than two per centum per
year” on the balance. N. Y. Gen. Oblig. Law Ann. §5–601 (West
2022). But Bank of America did not pay interest on the money in
Cantero’s escrow account or Hymes and Harwayne-Gidansky’s escrow
account. Bank of America notified the borrowers that the New York
law was preempted by the National Bank Act. Both plaintiffs brought
putative class-action suits against Bank of America in the U. S.
District Court for the Eastern District of New York, alleging that
Bank of America violated New York law by failing to pay them
interest on the balances in their escrow accounts.

															The District Court decided the two cases
together. The court agreed with the plaintiffs that New York law
required Bank of America to pay interest on the escrow account
balances. The court ruled that the New York interest-on-escrow law
applied to national banks such as Bank of America, concluding that
nothing in the National Bank Act or other federal law preempted the
New York law. Hymes v. Bank of America, N. A.,
408 F. Supp. 3d 171, 198 (EDNY 2019).

															The U. S. Court of Appeals for the Second
Circuit reversed, holding that the New York interest-on-escrow law
was preempted as applied to national banks. Relying primarily on
“an unbroken line of case law since McCulloch [v.
Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316 (1819)],” the Court of Appeals held
that federal law preempts any state law that “purports to exercise
control over a federally granted banking power,” regardless of “the
magnitude of its effects.” 49 F. 4th 121, 131 (2022). Because
the New York interest-on-escrow law “would exert control over”
national banks’ power “to create and fund escrow accounts,” the
court concluded that the law was preempted. Id., at 134.

															This Court granted certiorari. 601 U. S.
___ (2023).

															II

															Congress has instructed courts how to analyze
federal preemption of state laws regulating national banks. In the
wake of the 2008 financial crisis, Congress passed and President
Obama signed the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer
Protection Act of 2010. Pub. L. 111–203, 124Stat. 1376. Among other
things, Dodd-Frank established the controlling legal standard for
when a “State consumer financial law,” like New York’s
interest-on-escrow law, is preempted with respect to national
banks. 12 U. S. C. §25b.

															To begin, Dodd-Frank ruled out field preemption.
§25b(b)(4) (federal banking law “does not occupy the field in any
area of State law”). As a result, we know that not all state laws
regulating national banks are preempted.

															Instead, Dodd-Frank provided, as relevant here,
that the National Bank Act preempts a state law “only if” the state
law (i) discriminates against national banks as compared to state
banks; or (ii) “prevents or significantly interferes with the
exercise by the national bank of its powers,” as determined “in
accordance with the legal standard for preemption in the decision
of the Supreme Court of the United States in Barnett Bank of Marion
County, N. A. v. Nelson, Florida Insurance Commissioner,
et al., 517 U.S.
25 (1996).” §§25b(b)(1)(A), (B).

															New York’s interest-on-escrow law does not
discriminate against national banks. The question of whether New
York’s interest-on-escrow law is preempted therefore must be
analyzed under Dodd-Frank’s “prevents or significantly interferes”
preemption standard. To guide judicial application of that
preemption standard, Dodd-Frank expressly incorporates this Court’s
decision in Barnett Bank. The preemption question here
therefore must be decided “in accordance with” Barnett Bank,
as Dodd-Frank directs. §25b(b)(1)(B).[2]

															A

															In Barnett Bank, a Florida law prohibited
most banks from selling insurance. Barnett Bank of Marion Cty.,
N. A. v. Nelson, 517 U.S.
25, 29 (1996). A dispute arose because federal law authorized
national banks to sell insurance in small towns, and a national
bank wanted to sell insurance in a small Florida town. Id.,
at 28–29.

															This Court held that the Florida law was
preempted because the law significantly interfered with the
national bank’s ability to exercise a power—selling
insurance—authorized by federal law. Id., at 33–35.
Importantly, Barnett Bank made clear that a
non-discriminatory state banking law can be preempted even if it is
possible for the national bank to comply with both federal and
state law—there, by declining to sell insurance. Id., at 31.
The Court emphasized that federal law’s “grants of both enumerated
and incidental ‘powers’ to national banks” are “grants of authority
not normally limited by, but rather ordinarily pre-empting,
contrary state law.” Id., at 32. Congress had afforded
national banks a “broad, not a limited,” power to sell insurance—a
power “without relevant qualification.” Ibid. The Court
reasoned that “normally Congress would not want States to forbid,
or to impair significantly, the exercise of a power that Congress
explicitly granted.” Id., at 33. Because federal law
“explicitly grant[ed] a national bank an authorization, permission,
or power” with “no indication that Congress intended to subject
that power to local restriction,” the Court concluded that state
law could not limit national banks’ ability to sell insurance.
Id., at 34–35 (internal quotation marks omitted); see
id., at 37. But the Court added that its ruling did not
“deprive States of the power to regulate national banks, where
(unlike here) doing so does not prevent or significantly interfere
with the national bank’s exercise of its powers.” Id., at
33.

															In short, Barnett Bank decided that the
non-discriminatory Florida law at issue there significantly
interfered with the bank’s exercise of its powers, and thus was
preempted.

															B

															But Barnett Bank did not purport to
establish a clear line to demarcate when a state law “significantly
interfere[s] with the national bank’s exercise of its powers.”
Ibid. Instead, the Court analyzed the Court’s precedents on
that issue. Specifically, to determine whether the Florida law was
preempted, Barnett Bank looked to prior cases of this Court
where the state law was preempted, as well as several cases where
the state law was not preempted. Given Dodd-Frank’s direction to
identify significant interference “in accordance with” Barnett
Bank, courts addressing preemption questions in this context
must do as Barnett Bank did and likewise take account of
those prior decisions of this Court and similar precedents.
§25b(b)(1)(B).

															The paradigmatic example of significant
interference identified by Barnett Bank occurred in
Franklin National Bank of Franklin Square v. New
York, 347 U.S.
373 (1954). The New York law at issue in Franklin
prohibited most banks “from using the word ‘saving’ or ‘savings’ in
their advertising or business.” Id., at 374. The
Franklin Court concluded that the law was preempted because
it interfered with the national bank’s statutory power “to receive
savings deposits.” Id., at 374, 378–379. Importantly, the
New York law did not bar national banks from receiving savings
deposits, “or even” from “advertising that fact.” Id., at
378. Nonetheless, the Court determined that the New York law
significantly interfered with the banks’ power because the banks
could not advertise effectively “using the commonly understood
description which Congress has specifically selected” to describe
their activities: receiving savings deposits. Ibid. Federal
law gave national banks the power not only “to engage in a
business,” but also “to let the public know about it”—and state law
could not interfere with the national bank’s ability to do so
efficiently. Id., at 377–378.

															In Barnett Bank, the Court compared the
Florida insurance law at issue there to the New York
savings-deposit law at issue in Franklin, and the Court
concluded that the two state laws were “quite similar.” 517
U. S., at 33. Because the Florida law interfered with the
national bank’s power in a way similar to the New York law in
Franklin, the Florida law was preempted.

															Barnett Bank also pointed to a second
example of significant interference—Fidelity Federal Savings
& Loan Association v. De la Cuesta, 458 U.S.
141 (1982). In Fidelity, federal law allowed, but did
“not compel, federal savings and loans to include due-on-sale
clauses in their contracts.” Id., at 155. But California law
“limited” that right to circumstances where the federal savings and
loan association could make a showing that enforcing the
due-on-sale clause was reasonably necessary. Id., at
154–155; see also id., at 149. The federal savings and loan
association could readily comply with both the state and federal
laws. Id., at 155. Still, the Court ruled that the
California law was preempted because the savings and loan could not
exercise a due-on-sale clause “solely at its option.” Ibid.
(internal quotation marks omitted). The California law thus
interfered with “the flexibility given” to the savings and loan by
federal law. Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted).

															For purposes of applying Dodd-Frank’s preemption
standard, Franklin, Fidelity, and Barnett Bank
together illustrate the kinds of state laws that significantly
interfere with the exercise of a national bank power and thus are
preempted.

															C

															Of course, not all state laws regulating
national banks are preempted. As relevant here, Dodd-Frank preempts
a state law “only if” it “prevents or significantly interferes
with” national bank powers. §25b(b)(1)(B). To determine the kinds
of state-law interference that are not “significant” and that are
therefore not preempted, Barnett Bank again scoured this
Court’s precedents.

															First, Barnett Bank cited Anderson
National Bank v. Luckett, 321 U.S.
233 (1944), as the primary example of a case where state law
was not preempted. There, Kentucky law required banks to turn over
abandoned deposits to the State. Id., at 236. The
Anderson Court stated that the Kentucky law did not “not
infringe or interfere with any authorized function of the bank.”
Id., at 249. Even though national banks possess a federal
power to collect deposits, “an inseparable incident” of that power
is the “obligation to pay” the deposits “to the persons entitled to
demand payment according to the law of the state where it does
business.” Id., at 248–249. And Kentucky law simply allowed
the State to “demand payment of the accounts in the same way and to
the same extent that the depositors could” after the depositors
abandoned the account. Id., at 249. Therefore, the
Anderson Court concluded, Kentucky law did not “infringe the
national banking laws or impose an undue burden on the performance
of the banks’ functions.” Id., at 248; see also id.,
at 249.

															Anderson distinguished a seemingly
similar California law at issue in an earlier case, First
National Bank of San Jose v. California, 262 U.S.
366 (1923), where the Court had found the state law to be
preempted.

															In First National Bank of San Jose, the
California law allowed the State to claim deposits that went
“ ‘unclaimed for more than twenty years.’ ” Ibid.
Unlike Kentucky’s law, however, California did not require proof
that the account was abandoned. Rather, the California law
“attempt[ed] to qualify in an unusual way agreements between
national banks and their customers.” Id., at 370. Therefore,
the Court noted, the California law could cause customers to
“hesitate” before depositing funds at the bank—and thus interfere
with the “efficiency” of the national bank in receiving deposits.
Id., at 369–370.

															Anderson’s reasons for differentiating
the California law at issue in First National Bank of San
Jose help demonstrate when a state law regulating national
banks crosses the line from permissible to preempted. In contrast
to the California law in First National Bank of San Jose,
the Kentucky law in Anderson demanded proof that the
accounts were abandoned—and thus its rule was “as old as the common
law itself.” 321 U. S., at 251. So the Kentucky law could
produce no such deterrent effect—and it could apply to national
banks. Id., at 252.

															Barnett Bank also cited two other
examples of state laws that could apply to national banks. In
National Bank v. Commonwealth, 9 Wall. 353 (1870),
the Court determined that a Kentucky tax law was not preempted. The
Kentucky law at issue there taxed the shareholders of all banks
(including national banks) on their shares of bank stock.
Id., at 360. The Court explained that national banks are
“exempted from State legislation, so far as that legislation may
interfere with, or impair their efficiency in performing the
functions” that federal law authorizes them to perform. Id.,
at 362. But national banks are not “wholly withdrawn from the
operation of State legislation”; rather, they remain subject to
state law governing “their daily course of business” such as
generally applicable state contract, property, and debt-collection
laws. Id., at 361–362. Because the Kentucky tax “in no
manner hinder[ed]” the national bank’s banking operations, and
produced “no greater interference with the functions of the bank
than any other” law governing businesses, the law was not
preempted. Id., at 362–363.

															For similar reasons, the Court in
McClellan v. Chipman, 164 U.S.
347 (1896), another example cited by Barnett Bank,
concluded that a generally applicable Massachusetts contract law
was not preempted as applied to national banks. 164 U. S., at
357–358, 361. The Court noted that a generally applicable contract
law like Massachusetts’s could be said to act as “a restraint upon
the power of a national bank within the State to make such
contracts.” Id., at 358. But even so, such state laws could
apply to national banks as long as the state laws did not “in any
way impai[r] the efficiency of national banks or frustrat[e] the
purpose for which they were created.” Ibid.

															III

															In sum, Barnett Bank examined this
Court’s precedents to determine whether a state law regulating
national banks falls on the permissible or preempted side of the
significant-interference line. Those precedents furnish content to
Barnett Bank’s significant-interference test—and therefore
also to Dodd-Frank’s preemption standard incorporating Barnett
Bank.

															A court applying that Barnett Bank
standard must make a practical assessment of the nature and degree
of the interference caused by a state law. If the state law
prevents or significantly interferes with the national bank’s
exercise of its powers, the law is preempted. If the state law does
not prevent or significantly interfere with the national bank’s
exercise of its powers, the law is not preempted. In assessing the
significance of a state law’s interference, courts may consider the
interference caused by the state laws in Barnett Bank,
Franklin, Anderson, and the other precedents on which
Barnett Bank relied. If the state law’s interference with
national bank powers is more akin to the interference in cases like
Franklin, Fidelity, First National Bank of San
Jose, and Barnett Bank itself, then the state law is
preempted. If the state law’s interference with national bank
powers is more akin to the interference in cases like
Anderson, National Bank v. Commonwealth, and
McClellan, then the state law is not preempted.[3]

															In analyzing the New York interest-on-escrow law
at issue here, the Court of Appeals did not conduct that kind of
nuanced comparative analysis. Instead, the Court of Appeals relied
on a line of cases going back to McCulloch v.
Maryland to distill a categorical test that would preempt
virtually all state laws that regulate national banks, at least
other than generally applicable state laws such as contract or
property laws. Bank of America supports the Court of Appeals’
approach. By contrast, the plaintiffs would yank the preemption
standard to the opposite extreme, and would preempt virtually no
non-discriminatory state laws that apply to both state and national
banks.

															We appreciate the desire by both parties for a
clearer preemption line one way or the other. But Congress
expressly incorporated Barnett Bank into the U. S.
Code. And in determining whether the Florida law at issue there was
preempted, Barnett Bank did not draw a bright line. Instead,
Barnett Bank sought to carefully account for and navigate
this Court’s prior bank preemption cases. Applying those
precedents, Barnett Bank ruled that some (but not all)
non-discriminatory state laws that regulate national banks are
preempted. Under Dodd-Frank, as relevant here, courts may find a
state law preempted “only if,” “in accordance with the legal
standard” from Barnett Bank, the law “prevents or
significantly interferes with the exercise by the national bank of
its powers.” §25b(b)(1)(B).

															Because the Court of Appeals did not analyze
preemption in a manner consistent with Dodd-Frank and Barnett
Bank, we vacate the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand
the case for further proceedings consistent with this
opinion.[4]

															

															It is so ordered.

Notes
1
 Another federal law, the
Truth in Lending Act, also addresses national banks’ operation of
mortgage-escrow accounts. The Truth in Lending Act requires
national banks to operate escrow accounts for certain mortgages.
82Stat. 146, 15 U. S. C. §1639d. For those mandatory
escrow accounts, the national bank must “pay interest” to the
borrower “in the manner as prescribed by [an] applicable State or
Federal law.” §1639d(g)(3). All parties agree that §1639d does not
apply to the mortgages in this case.
2
 Cantero’s mortgage
agreement (unlike Hymes and Harwayne-Gidansky’s mortgage agreement)
was signed after Dodd-Frank was enacted but before Dodd-Frank
became effective. Because we conclude that Dodd-Frank adopted
Barnett Bank, and because Barnett Bank was also the
governing preemption standard before Dodd-Frank, the timing of
Cantero’s mortgage agreement does not affect the preemption
analysis here.
3
 In Barnett Bank
and each of the earlier precedents, the Court reached its
conclusions about the nature and degree of the state laws’ alleged
interference with the national banks’ exercise of their powers
based on the text and structure of the laws, comparison to other
precedents, and common sense. See, e.g., Barnett
Bank of Marion Cty., N. A. v. Nelson, 517 U.S.
25, 33–35 (1996) (comparing Florida law at issue to New York
law in Franklin); Franklin National Bank of Franklin
Square v. New York, 347 U.S.
373, 378 (1954) (concluding that New York law interfered with
ability to use “a particular label” that federal law “specifically
selected”); First National Bank of San Jose v.
California, 262 U.S.
366, 370 (1923) (reasoning that customers “might well hesitate”
to subject their deposits to “unusual” California law); Anderson
National Bank v. Luckett, 321 U.S.
233, 247–248 (1944) (determining that no “word in the national
banking laws . . . expressly or by implication conflicts
with the provisions of  the Kentucky statutes”); id.,
at 249–252 (comparing the likely effect of the Kentucky law to the
likely effect of the California law in First National Bank of
San Jose).
4
 During the course of the
litigation, the parties have raised two other issues that the Court
of Appeals did not address and that it may address as appropriate
on remand: first, the significance here (if any) of the preemption
rules of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency; and second,
the relevance here (if any) of the Dodd-Frank provision that
preempts state consumer financial laws if a federal law “other than
title 62 of the Revised Statutes” preempts the state law, 12
U. S. C. §25b(b)(1)(C).
