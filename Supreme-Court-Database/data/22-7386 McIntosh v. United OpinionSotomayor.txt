															LOUIS McINTOSH, aka LOU D, PETITIONER
v. UNITED STATES

															on writ of certiorari to the united states
court of appeals for the second circuit

															[April 17, 2024]

															

															Justice Sotomayor delivered the opinion of the
Court.

															In certain criminal cases, Congress has
authorized the Government to seek forfeiture of a defendant’s
ill-gotten gains as part of the defendant’s sentence. Federal Rule
of Criminal Procedure 32.2 sets forth specific procedures for
imposing criminal forfeiture in such cases. In particular, Rule
32.2(b)(2)(B) provides that, “[u]nless doing so is impractical,” a
federal district court “must enter the preliminary order [of
forfeiture] sufficiently in advance of sentencing to allow the
parties to suggest revisions or modifications before the order
becomes final as to the defendant.”

															The question presented in this case is whether a
district court that fails to comply with Rule 32.2(b)(2)(B)’s
requirement to enter a preliminary order before sentencing is
powerless to order forfeiture against the defendant. In light of
the Rule’s text and relevant precedents, this Court holds that the
failure to enter a preliminary order does not bar a judge from
ordering forfeiture at sentencing subject to harmless-error
principles on appellate review.

															I

															Between 2009 and 2011, Louis McIntosh
committed a series of violent robberies and attempted robberies in
New York. In one such robbery, McIntosh and two others held a man
at gunpoint, bound and gagged him in his basement, and then took
$70,000 in cash from the man’s house. Five days later, McIntosh
bought a BMW for approximately $10,000 with cash and money orders
and listed his mother as the buyer.

															In June 2011, McIntosh was indicted along with
five others on multiple counts of Hobbs Act robbery and firearm
offenses. The indictment set forth that, for the Hobbs Act robbery
counts, the defendants “shall forfeit to the United States
. . . all property . . . that constitutes or is
derived from proceeds traceable to the commission of the offenses,
including but not limited to a sum in United States currency
representing the amount of proceeds obtained as a result of the
offenses.” App. 10–11. The Government provided McIntosh with a
pretrial bill of particulars the next month that listed the BMW as
“property subject to forfeiture.” Id., at 12, 14.

															A jury convicted McIntosh on all
counts.[1] On May 23, 2014, the
District Court held the sentencing hearing. The Government had not
mentioned the forfeiture in its sentencing memorandum, and the
District Court did not enter a preliminary order of forfeiture
prior to the hearing. At the hearing, however, the Government
stated that it was seeking forfeiture for “$75,000 in a money
judgment, as well as the BMW.” Id., at 54. The Government
offered to submit a proposed order “within the next week.”
Ibid. McIntosh objected to the forfeiture. He argued that
there was no “dispositive” evidence connecting the BMW to any
robbery proceeds, insisting that a family member had purchased the
car. Id., at 54–55. It is not clear from the record whether
McIntosh’s objection to the forfeiture was also based on the
absence of a preliminary order.

															The District Court overruled McIntosh’s
objection to the forfeiture based on the trial evidence that the
Government presented. As part of the sentence, the District Court
imposed a forfeiture of “$75,000 and the BMW” as “fruits of the
crime[s],” and ordered the Government to “submit an order of
forfeiture for signature by the Court within a week.” Id.,
at 62. The written judgment memorialized these
instructions.[2]
Notwithstanding the District Court’s order, the Government failed
to submit a proposed order of forfeiture.

															On appeal, the Government moved for a limited
remand to the District Court to “supplement the record by entering
the formal orde[r] of . . . forfeiture.” Id., at
68. The Government conceded that McIntosh could then “contes[t] the
timeliness of [a formal forfeiture] order,” and the District Court
could “make whatever findings it deem[ed] appropriate.” Id.,
at 71. The Second Circuit granted the Government’s unopposed motion
and remanded the case.

															Back in the District Court, McIntosh objected to
the Government’s newly proposed order. McIntosh argued that the
District Court failed to comply with Rule 32.2(b)(2)(B) when it did
not enter a preliminary order prior to his original sentencing, and
thus it could not proceed with forfeiture at all. In McIntosh’s
view, the delay prejudiced him because the BMW lost value while the
forfeiture issue was litigated, which meant he would be credited
less money against his money judgment.

															The District Court again overruled McIntosh’s
objections. It concluded that Rule 32.2(b)(2)(B) is a time-related
directive, rather than a jurisdictional deadline or a mandatory
claim-processing rule, and thus the court retained the power to
order forfeiture. The failure to comply with the time-related
directive, the court found, did not prejudice McIntosh.
Accordingly, the District Court entered the proposed order of
forfeiture and entered an amended judgment reflecting the
order.

															The Second Circuit affirmed in relevant part.
Like the District Court, the Court of Appeals concluded that Rule
32.2(b)(2)(B) is a “ ‘time-related directiv[e],’ ” which
does “ ‘not deprive a judge . . . of the power to
take the action to which the deadline applies if the deadline is
missed.’ ” 58 F. 4th 606, 609 (2023) (quoting Dolan v.
United States, 560 U.S.
605, 611 (2010)). The Second Circuit also rejected McIntosh’s
prejudice argument. In an accompanying summary order, the Second
Circuit vacated the judgment in part and remanded for recalculation
of the forfeiture amount because the $75,000 figure reflected the
total proceeds of the robberies rather than the amount McIntosh
personally received. See 2023 WL 382945, *2 (Jan. 25, 2023).

															McIntosh filed a petition for a writ of
certiorari, alleging a split among the Courts of Appeals on the
consequences of failing to adhere to Rule 32.2(b)’s
requirements.[3] During the
second remand, while the petition was pending, the District Court
entered an agreed-upon preliminary order of forfeiture for $28,000
and the BMW. On September 20, 2023, the District Court entered its
final forfeiture order. Days later, this Court granted McIntosh’s
petition limited to the question “[w]hether a district court may
enter a criminal forfeiture order outside the time limitations set
forth in Rule 32.2.” Pet. for Cert. i. See 600 U. S. ___
(2023).

															II

															Rule 32.2(b)(2)(B) provides: “Unless doing so
is impractical, the court must enter the preliminary order [of
forfeiture] sufficiently in advance of sentencing to allow the
parties to suggest revisions or modifications before the order
becomes final as to the defendant.” The order becomes final either
at sentencing or before then if the defendant consents. See Fed.
Rule Crim. Proc. 32.2(b)(4)(A). It is undisputed that the
District Court did not comply with Rule 32.2(b)(2)(B) when it
failed to enter a preliminary order of forfeiture before McIntosh’s
initial sentencing. Despite that error, the District Court retained
its power to order forfeiture against McIntosh.

															A

															This Court has identified three types of time
limits: (1) jurisdictional deadlines; (2) mandatory
claim-processing rules; and (3) time-related directives. See
Dolan, 560 U. S., at 610–611. Jurisdictional deadlines
are rare. See United States v. Kwai Fun Wong,
575 U.S.
402, 410 (2015) (“[M]ost time bars are nonjurisdictional”). If
the court misses a jurisdictional deadline, it is completely
powerless to take any relevant action, and the “parties cannot
waive” the deadline. Dolan, 560 U. S., at 610. Put
differently, noncompliance with a jurisdictional deadline cannot be
excused. No one contends that Rule 32.2(b)(2)(B) is jurisdictional
because it “does not expressly refer to subject-matter jurisdiction
or speak in jurisdictional terms.” Musacchio v. United
States, 577 U.S.
237, 246 (2016). Instead, the parties’ dispute revolves around
the other two types of time limits.

															Mandatory claim-processing rules “regulate the
timing of motions or claims brought before the court.”
Dolan, 560 U. S., at 610. That is why, generally
speaking, “filing deadlines” are the “ ‘quintessential
claim-processing rules.’ ” Sebelius v. Auburn
Regional Medical Center, 568 U.S.
145, 154 (2013). If the affected party alerts the court to the
deadline and invokes its protection, the relevant action cannot be
taken after the deadline has passed. Unlike jurisdictional limits,
though, mandatory claim-processing rules are subject to waiver and
forfeiture by a litigant. Dolan, 560 U. S., at 610.

															Time-related directives “see[k] speed” by
directing “a judge or other public official” to act by a certain
time. Id., at 611. Missing that kind of deadline does not
deprive the official of “the power to take the action to which the
deadline applies.” Ibid. Moreover, whereas noncompliance
with a mandatory claim-processing rule is presumed to be
prejudicial, Manrique v. United States, 581 U.S. 116,
125 (2017), the failure to follow a time-related directive is, in
this context, subject to harmless-error principles on appellate
review, Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 52(a).

															McIntosh contends that Rule 32.2(b)(2)(B) is a
mandatory claim-processing rule, and thus the District Court could
not order forfeiture once McIntosh objected to the absence of a
preliminary order prior to his initial sentencing. The Government,
on the other hand, argues that Rule 32.2(b)(2)(B) is a flexible
time-related directive, and thus the absence of a preliminary order
did not bar the District Court from ordering forfeiture at
sentencing.[4]

															This Court agrees with the Second Circuit and
the Government that Rule 32.2(b)(2)(B) establishes a time-related
directive. Accordingly, a district judge’s failure to enter a
preliminary order prior to sentencing does not deprive a judge of
the power to order forfeiture.

															B

															In Dolan v. United States, this
Court similarly addressed the proper remedy for when a district
court misses a deadline to take action related to criminal
sentencing. That case involved a provision in the Mandatory Victims
Restitution Act of 1996, which states that,“[i]f the victim’s
losses are not ascertainable by the date that is 10 days prior to
sentencing, . . . the court shall set a date for the
final determination of the victim’s losses, not to exceed 90 days
after sentencing.” 18 U. S. C. §3664(d)(5). This Court
noted that the statute “ ‘d[id] not specify a consequence for
noncompliance with’ ” the deadline. Dolan, 560
U. S., at 611 (quoting United States v. James Daniel
Good Real Property, 510 U.S.
43, 63 (1993)). It then held that the provision was a
time-related directive, such that, if “a sentencing court misses
the statute’s 90-day deadline, even through its own fault or that
of the Government,” the sentencing court retains “the power to
order restitution” in that circumstance. 560 U. S., at
611.
Dolan was just the latest in a line of
cases recognizing that certain deadlines, if missed, do not deprive
a public official of the power to take the action to which the
deadline applies. See, e.g., Barnhart v.
Peabody Coal Co., 537 U.S.
149, 171–172 (2003) (missed deadline for assigning industry
retiree benefits did not prevent later award of benefits);
Regions Hospital v. Shalala, 522
U.S. 448, 459, n. 3 (1998) (missed deadline to submit
agency report did not deprive official of “power to act beyond
it”); James Daniel Good, 510 U. S., at 63–65 (missed
deadline for civil-forfeiture proceedings did not prevent federal
officers from seeking forfeiture of property used to commit a
federal drug offense); United States v.
Montalvo-Murillo, 495 U.S.
711, 717–718 (1990) (missed deadline to hold bail hearing did
not require the release of pretrial detainee); Brock v.
Pierce County, 476 U.S.
253, 266 (1986) (missed deadline to determine misuse of federal
grant funds did not “divest [public official] of jurisdiction to
act after that time”).

															Each of these cases involved timing provisions
that did not specify a consequence for the public
officials’James Daniel Good, 510 U. S., at 63 (quoting
French v. Edwards, 13 Wall. 506, 511 (1872)). In such
circumstances, “courts will not in the ordinary course impose their
own coercive sanction,” 510 U. S., at 63, nor typically
attribute “intent to limit an [official’s] power to get a mandatory
job done merely from a specification to act by a certain time,”
Barnhart, 537 U. S., at 160.

															C

															In this Court’s taxonomy of time limits, Rule
32.2(b)(2)(B) is best understood as a time-related directive. It
functions “as a spur to prompt action, not as a bar to tardy
completion of . . . business.” Id., at 172.
Several features of the Rule guide this Court’s analysis.

															First, far from imposing “rigid” constraints
characteristic of mandatory claim-processing rules, the plain
language of the Rule contemplates flexibility regarding the timing
of a preliminary order’s entry. Eberhart v. United
States, 546 U.S.
12, 13 (2005) (per curiam). It requires that a
preliminary order of forfeiture be entered before sentencing,
“[u]nless doing so is impractical.” Rule 32.2(b)(2)(B). As such,
the Rule anticipates that, in some circumstances, it may be
“impractical” to enter a preliminary order of forfeiture before
sentencing. Similarly, the Rule contains the indeterminate command
that a preliminary order be entered “sufficiently in advance
of sentencing to allow the parties to suggest revisions or
modifications before the order becomes final as to the defendant.”
Ibid. (emphasis added). Of course, what is sufficient in one
case may not be in another. Both the impracticality exception and
the sufficiently-in-advance condition take the Rule further away
from the category of “rigid” and “ ‘inflexible
claim-processing rule[s].’ ” Eberhart, 546 U. S.,
at 13.[5]

															Second, Rule 32.2(b)(2)(B) “ ‘does not
specify a consequence for noncompliance with its timing
provisions.’ ” 58 F. 4th, at 610 (quoting Dolan,
560 U. S., at 611). In the absence of such specification,
courts “will not in the ordinary course impose their own coercive
sanction” for noncompliance with a timing directive. James
Daniel Good, 510 U. S., at 63. Indeed, it would be
especially strange to prohibit a sentencing court from ordering
forfeiture for not complying with Rule 32.2(b)(2)(B) where other
parts of Rule 32.2 specify that consequence for noncompliance. Rule
32.2(a), for example, provides that the Government’s failure to
include a forfeiture allegation in the indictment means that the
“court must not enter a judgment of forfeiture.” The use of
“ ‘explicit language’ ” specifying a sanction in Rule
32.2(a) but not in Rule 32.2(b)(2)(B) “ ‘cautions against
inferring’ the same limitation” in Rule 32.2(b)(2)(B). State
Farm Fire & Casualty Co. v. United States ex rel.
Rigsby, 580 U.S. 26, 34 (2016).

															Third, “Rule 32.2(b)(2)(B) governs the conduct
of the district court, not the litigants.” 58 F. 4th, at 611.
Recall that time-related directives typically spur public officials
to act within a specified time. Mandatory claim-processing rules,
by contrast, ordinarily “requir[e] that the parties take
certain procedural steps at certain specified times.”
Henderson v. Shinseki, 562 U.S.
428, 435 (2011) (emphasis added). That distinction holds even
in the examples that McIntosh identified of claim-processing rules
addressed to courts. Take Santos-Zacaria v. Garland,
598 U.S. 411 (2023), and Gonzalez v. Thaler,
565 U.S.
134 (2012), for example. See Brief for Petitioner 34–35; Tr. of
Oral Arg. 13. The claim-processing rules in those cases conditioned
the court’s authority to act on the parties’ adherence to a certain
procedure, and not on the court’s compliance with a deadline. See
Santos-Zacaria, 598 U. S., at 416 (analyzing provision
stating that “ ‘[a] court may review a final order of removal
only if . . . the alien has exhausted all administrative
remedies available to the alien as of right’ ”);
Gonzalez, 565 U. S., at 140 (analyzing provision
stating that a court of appeals “ ‘may issue’ ” a
certificate of appealability “ ‘only if the applicant has made
a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional
right’ ”). McIntosh has not identified a mandatory
claim-processing rule that is analogous to Rule 32.2(b)(2)(B).

															In sum, Rule 32.2(b)(2)(B) is a time-related
directive that, if missed, does not deprive the judge of her power
to order forfeiture against the defendant.

															III

															McIntosh’s arguments to the contrary are
unpersuasive. He first points to Rule 32.2(b)(2)(B)’s use of the
word “must” to highlight its mandatory character. Yet this kind of
mandatory language standing “alone has not always led this Court to
interpret statutes to bar judges (or other officials) from taking
action to which a missed statutory deadline refers.” Dolan,
560 U. S., at 611–612; see also id., at 607–608
(concluding that statute providing that a sentencing court
“ ‘shall set a date’ ” within a specified time period to
determine restitution amount was a time-related directive);
Barnhart, 537 U. S., at 152 (“ ‘shall’
. . . assign ”); Regions Hospital, 522
U. S., at 459, n. 3 (“ ‘shall report’ ”);
Montalvo-Murillo, 495 U. S., at 717 (“ ‘shall hold
a hearing’ ”); Brock, 476 U. S., at 256
(“ ‘shall’ determine ”). Additionally, Rule
32.2(b)(2)(B)’s use of “must” has to be construed in context to
determine whether its time limit is a mandatory claim-processing
rule or a time-related directive. That context, as discussed above,
demonstrates that the Rule contemplates some flexibility by
specifying that the preliminary order be entered “sufficiently in
advance of sentencing,” “[u]nless doing so is impractical.” Rule
32.2(b)(2)(B); see supra, at 8–9.

															McIntosh also argues that it “makes sense” to
classify Rule 32.2(b)(2)(B) as a mandatory claim-processing rule
because Rule 32.2 requires the Government to take specific steps
“to move the criminal forfeiture process forward.” Brief for
Petitioner 11. For example, the Government must provide notice in
the indictment that it “will seek the forfeiture of property as
part of any sentence,” “establis[h] the requisite nexus between the
property and the offense,” and “publish . . . and send
notice” of the forfeiture order to potential claimants. Fed. Rules
Crim. Proc. 32.2(a), (b)(1)(A), (b)(6)(A). Although McIntosh is
correct that the Government plays an indispensable role in the
criminal forfeiture process, Rule 32.2(b)(2)(B) is directed
exclusively to the sentencing court. It does not even mention the
Government. That the instruction to the court may in turn push the
Government to take certain steps as a practical matter does not
change the Rule’s addressee.[6]

															McIntosh further contends that an affirmance
here would deprive Rule 32.2(b)(2)(B) of any effect such that it
“might as well not exist.” Brief for Petitioner 3. Not so. In most
cases, a timely objection required to preserve a claim of error
likely will prompt the district court to enter the preliminary
order and, if appropriate, postpone sentencing. As counsel for
McIntosh conceded at argument, defendants receive the benefit of
the Rule in that situation. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 11–12. If a timely
objection is raised and no preliminary order is entered, at the
very least, the violation of Rule 32.2(b)(2)(B) would be reviewed
for harmlessness. See Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 52(a); see also
United States v. Lee, 77 F. 4th 565, 583 (CA7
2023) (reviewing a Rule 32.2(b)(2)(B) violation for harmless
error); United States v. Farias, 836 F.3d 1315, 1330
(CA11 2016) (same).

															Finally, McIntosh falls back on the general
purpose of Rule 32.2, which he describes as “ensur[ing] criminal
defendants receive due process before their property is permanently
taken by the government” and “promot[ing] judicial economy.” Brief
for Petitioner 11. That is all true. McIntosh does not explain,
though, how it promotes judicial economy to treat Rule
32.2(b)(2)(B) as an inflexible claim-processing rule. If anything,
judicial economy is better served by allowing courts some
flexibility to ensure the accuracy and completeness of the final
forfeiture order and address an inadvertent failure to enter a
preliminary order in advance of sentencing. Because McIntosh has
not shown that reading the requirement as a time-related directive
would frustrate significantly Rule 32.2’s effectiveness, McIntosh’s
invocation of purpose falls flat.

															IV

															Noncompliance with Rule 32.2(b)(2)(B)’s timing
requirement is a procedural error subject to harmlessness review.
Here, the Second Circuit agreed with the District Court that
McIntosh failed to show “prejudice sufficient to void the
forfeiture order.” 58 F. 4th, at 611. Both courts noted
McIntosh knew from the time of his indictment in 2011 and from the
pretrial bill of particulars that the Government sought forfeiture.
Both courts also rejected the argument that the absence of a timely
preliminary order prejudiced McIntosh by causing the BMW to lose
value. They explained that McIntosh “could have sought an
interlocutory sale of the car if he had wished to preserve its
value” and could have done so without a preliminary order.
Ibid.

															McIntosh did not challenge the lower courts’
harmlessness analysis in either his certiorari petition or his
opening brief, so this Court need not revisit it.

															*  *  *

															Because Rule 32.2(b)(2)(B) is a time-related
directive that, if missed, does not deprive a district court of its
power to order forfeiture, the judgment of the Court of Appeals for
the Second Circuit is

															Affirmed.

Notes
1
 The District Court
subsequently directed a judgment of acquittal on two counts of
attempted robbery.
2
 The judgment instructed
McIntosh to forfeit “$95,000” instead of “$75,000,” App. 50, but
the District Court later corrected this conceded clerical error in
the amended judgment.
3
 According to McIntosh’s
petition, the Eighth Circuit treats Rule 32.2(b)’s deadline as
jurisdictional, see United States v. Shakur, 691 F.3d
979 (2012); the Sixth Circuit treats it as a mandatory
claim-processing rule, see United States v. Maddux,
37 F. 4th 1170 (2022); and the Fourth Circuit, like the Second
Circuit below, treats it as a time-related directive, see United
States v. Martin, 662 F.3d 301 (2011). See Pet. for
Cert. i; but see United States v. Lee, 77 F. 4th 565,
577 (CA7 2023) (explaining that, while it “appears at first glance
that there is conflict, . . . a closer look at the
decisions suggests that there may be less difference than meets the
eye”).
4
 The parties disagree on
whether McIntosh timely objected to thelack of a preliminary order
at the initial sentencing and whether he relinquished any objection
by agreeing to the entry of the revised, now-operative order of
forfeiture during the second remand. The Government argues that, if
this Court agrees with McIntosh that Rule 32.2(b)(2)(B) is a
mandatory claim-processing rule, the case should be remanded to
determine whether McIntosh forfeited such an objection “under the
particular circumstances of this case.” Brief for United States 17.
Because this Court, however, agrees with the Government’s view of
Rule 32.2(b)(2)(B), a remand is not warranted.
5
 Because the District
Court ordered the forfeiture at McIntosh’s initial sentencing, this
case does not implicate Rule 32.2(b)(4)(B)’s requirement that
forfeiture be imposed at sentencing. Cf. Lee, 77 F. 4th, at
582 (explaining that, although “the requirement of a
preliminary order is a time-related directive,
. . . [t]he requirement that [a final order] must be
included in the oral judgment of the court has the character of a
claims-processing rule”); Tr. of Oral Arg. 34–36 (Government
counsel stating that the requirements relating to the final order’s
entry raise “a harder set of issues” for the Government, which are
not implicated in this case).
6
 The Government explains
that the Department of Justice instructs its prosecutors to
recommend a preliminary order of forfeiture prior to sentencing to
assist judges at sentencing. See Brief for United States 26 (citing
Dept. of Justice, Money Laundering and Asset Recovery Section,
Asset Forfeiture Policy Manual 5–22 (2023)). Here, in circumstances
that this Court expects are a rare occurrence, the Government
admits that McIntosh’s prosecutors failed to adhere to this
guidance multiple times over. The prosecutors failed to:
(1) remind the court of its Rule 32.2(b)(2)(B) obligation;
(2) prepare a proposed preliminary order prior to sentencing;
(3) comply with the District Court’s instruction at sentencing
to submit a proposed order of forfeiture within a week from the
hearing; and (4) comply with the District Court’s instruction
in the judgment to submit a written order within one week of
issuance of the judgment. Notwithstanding these failures, Rule
32.2(b)(2)(B)’s plain terms require a district court, and not the
prosecutors, to enter a preliminary order.
