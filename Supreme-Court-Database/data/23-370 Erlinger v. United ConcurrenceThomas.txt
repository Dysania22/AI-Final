															SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

															_________________

															No. 23–370

															_________________

															PAUL ERLINGER, PETITIONER v. UNITED
STATES

															on writ of certiorari to the united states
court of appeals for the seventh circuit

															[June 21, 2024]

															

															Justice Thomas, concurring.

															I join the Court’s opinion in full because it
correctly applies our precedents. The fact that a defendant’s prior
qualifying offenses occurred on “occasions different from one
another” results in an increased punishment under the Armed Career
Criminal Act. 18 U. S. C. §924(e)(1). The Sixth Amendment
therefore gives criminal defendants the right to have a jury find
that fact. See Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U.S.
466, 501 (2000) (Thomas, J., concurring) (“[A] ‘crime’ includes
every fact that is by law a basis for imposing or increasing
punishment” (emphasis added)).

															In Almendarez-Torres v. United
States, 523 U.S.
224 (1998), the Court created a “narrow exception” to the Sixth
Amendment’s general rule and allowed a judge to find “the fact of a
prior conviction,” even though that fact increases a defendant’s
punishment, Alleyne v. United States, 570 U.S.
99, 111, n. 1 (2013). In this case, the Court acknowledges
the sharp conflict between Almendarez-Torres and the Sixth
Amendment. Ante, at 13–14. And, it properly declines to
extend that dubious exception to the different-occasions inquiry
under §924(e)(1). Ante, at 13–19.

															I continue to adhere to my view that we should
revisit Almendarez-Torres and correct the “error to which I
succumbed” by joining that decision. Apprendi, 530
U. S., at 520 (opinion of Thomas, J.); see also
Sessions v. Dimaya, 584 U.S. 148, 226 (2018) (Thomas,
J., dissenting); Mathis v. United States, 579 U.S.
500, 522 (2016) (Thomas, J., concurring); Descamps v.
United States, 570 U.S.
254, 280–281 (2013) (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment);
Rangel-Reyes v. United States, 547 U.S. 1200, 1202
(2006) (Thomas, J., dissenting from denial of certiorari);
Shepard v. United States, 544 U.S.
13, 27–28 (2005) (Thomas, J., concurring in part and concurring
in judgment). We need not overrule Almendarez-Torres to rule
in Erlinger’s favor, and he did not ask us to reconsider the
decision—although he agrees that it should be overruled. Tr. of
Oral Arg. 5. But, we have no shortage of other cases. Each Term,
criminal defendants file a flood of petitions “specifically
presenting this Court with opportunities to reconsider
Almendarez-Torres.” Rangel-Reyes, 547 U. S., at
1202 (opinion of Thomas, J.). Today’s decision demonstrates further
that “[i]t is time for this Court to do its part” by granting one
of those many petitions and overruling Almendarez-Torres.
Rangel-Reyes, 547 U. S., at 1202.
