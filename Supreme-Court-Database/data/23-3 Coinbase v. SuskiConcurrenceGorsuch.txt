															SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

															_________________

															No. 23–3

															_________________

															COINBASE, INC., PETITIONER v. DAVID
SUSKI, et al.

															on writ of certiorari to the united states
court of appeals for the ninth circuit

															[May 23, 2024]

															

															Justice Gorsuch, concurring.

															Often, parties choose to send disputes arising
from their contracts to an arbitrator instead of a court.
Ante, at 4; see 9 U. S. C. §2. Just as often, it
seems, parties later wind up disagreeing about whether a particular
dispute is subject to that arbitration agreement. Sometimes a court
can resolve their disagreement about the “arbitrability” of a
particular dispute. But sometimes not. For parties can agree to
send arbitrability questions to an arbitrator too, through what
this Court calls a delegation clause. Ante, at 4–5; Henry
Schein, Inc. v. Archer & White Sales, Inc., 586 U.S.
63, 65 (2019).

															What happens when (as in this case) the parties
have two contracts, one with a delegation clause, a second without,
and a dispute later arises? Like everything else in this area, it
depends on what the parties have agreed. Ante, at 4.
Sometimes, a court may conclude that the parties’ agreements are
best read as leaving for the court the task of resolving the
arbitrability of the dispute at hand. But sometimes, the parties’
agreements may be best read as vesting that power in an arbitrator.
Just imagine a master contract providing that “all disputes arising
out of or related to this or future agreements between the parties,
including questions concerning whether a dispute should be routed
to arbitration, shall be decided by an arbitrator.” Absent some
later amendment, a provision like that would seem to require a
court to step aside. See ante, at 8.

															It is not clear to me whether the Ninth Circuit
appreciated this point. But nor does that matter. Our decision
today recognizes—and stresses—that “[a]rbitration is a matter of
contract,” ante, at 1, and parties can “ ‘agree by
contract that an arbitrator, rather than a court, will resolve
threshold arbitrability questions as well as underlying merits
disputes,’ ” ante, at 4 (quoting Henry Schein,
586 U. S., at 65). Notably, too, the Court does not endorse
the reasoning in the Ninth Circuit’s opinion, let alone its state
contract law analysis of the parties’ agreements. See ante,
at 7–8. Instead, the Court simply reaffirms well-established
principles about the primacy of the parties’ agreements when it
comes to arbitration, ante, at 4, and the Ninth Circuit’s
“bottom-line conclusion” that a court had to decide whether and to
what extent the parties here reached “an agreement” to have an
arbitrator resolve the question of arbitrability, ante, at
1–2, 6. With that understanding, I am pleased to concur.
