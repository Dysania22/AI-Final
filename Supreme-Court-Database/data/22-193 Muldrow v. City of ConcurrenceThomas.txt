															SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

															No. 22–193

															_________________

															Jatonya Clayborn Muldrow, PETITIONER v.
City of St. Louis, Missouri, et al.

															on writ of certiorari to the united states
court of appeals for the eighth circuit

															[April 17, 2024]

															

															Justice Thomas, concurring in the
judgment.

															I agree with Justice Alito that the Courts of
Appeals all appear to articulate the same principle, but with
slightly varying verbal formulations: A plaintiff bringing a claim
under 42 U. S. C. §2000e–2(a)(1) must show harm that is
more than trifling. Post, at 1–2 (opinion concurring in
judgment). And, there is little practical difference between that
principle and the Court’s holding. Ante, at 1 (holding that
an employee “must show some harm”).

															I am not convinced, however, that the Court
accurately characterizes the Eighth Circuit’s decision. I do not
read the Eighth Circuit to have necessarily imposed a
heightened-harm requirement in the form of a “significance” test.
The Eighth Circuit defined an adverse employment action as “a
tangible change in working conditions that produces a material
employment disadvantage.” 30 F. 4th 680, 688 (2022) (internal
quotation marks omitted). It further explained that “minor changes
in duties or working conditions, even unpalatable or unwelcome
ones, which cause no materially significant disadvantage, do not
rise to the level of an adverse employment action.” Ibid.
(alteration and internal quotation marks omitted). In other words,
a plaintiff must have suffered an actual disadvantage as compared
to minor changes—i.e., more than a trifling harm. That
standard aligns with the Court’s observation that a plaintiff must
show “some ‘disadvantageous’ change in an employment term or
condition.” Ante, at 5 (quoting Oncale v.
Sundowner Offshore Services, Inc., 523 U.S.
75, 80 (1998)).

															The Court insists that the Eighth Circuit must
have demanded more given the weight of Muldrow’s allegations.
Specifically, the Court underscores Muldrow’s claims that the City
of St. Louis “moved [her] from a plainclothes job in a
prestigious specialized division” with a take-home car and a
regular schedule, to a “uniformed job supervising one district’s
patrol officers,” with no take-home car and an irregular schedule.
Ante, at 10. But, most of those allegations are forfeited or
attributable to a nonparty, the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
See 2020 WL 5505113, *9, n. 20 (ED Mo., Sept. 11, 2020)
(observing that Muldrow did not raise arguments based on “having to
return her take-home [car],” “changes to her schedule, including
having to work weekends,” or “having to work in plain clothes”); 30
F. 4th, at 689 (concluding that “the FBI had the sole
authority to revoke” Muldrow’s plainclothes and take-home car
privileges). Before the Eighth Circuit, Muldrow argued only that
the City moved her to a job that was “more administrative and less
prestigious.” Id., at 688. Her “only evidence” in support of
that argument was “her own deposition testimony,” which neither the
District Court nor the Eighth Circuit found persuasive.
Ibid. And, Muldrow’s testimony certainly did not establish
any “proof of harm resulting from [her] reassignment.” Ibid.
After the transfer, Muldrow’s “pay and rank remained the same, she
was given a supervisory role, and she was responsible for
investigating violent crimes, such as homicides and robberies.”
Ibid. Muldrow even conceded that the transfer “did not harm
her future career prospects.” Ibid. At most, then, Muldrow
“expresse[d] a mere preference for one position over the other.”
Id., at 689.

															Muldrow failed to prove that there was any
nontrifling change in her job’s prestige—which was her lone theory
of harm. Id., at 688–689. The Eighth Circuit rejected
Muldrow’s adverse employment action claim accordingly. I fail to
see how the Eighth Circuit’s reasoning—that a plaintiff must offer
colorable evidence of harm—is equivalent to the heightened-harm
requirement the Court concludes the Eighth Circuit applied.
Ante, at 10 (agreeing that “[t]he transfer must have left
[Muldrow] worse off ”).

															All that said, I recognize that the terms
“material” and “significant” can (but do not always) imply a
heightened-harm requirement. Although I find it unlikely, it is
possible that the Eighth Circuit had such a stringent test in mind
when it stated that a plaintiff must show a “ ‘materially
significant disadvantage.’ ” 30 F. 4th, at 688. I thus
agree to vacate and remand to the extent the Eighth Circuit’s
analysis is inconsistent with a more-than-trifling-harm
requirement.
